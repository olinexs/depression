301,thank you mmm k i'm doing good thank you i'm from los angeles oh great i live in west los angeles the west side it's alright i xxx no i live alone so i love it i'm from here so i grew up here it's natural the weather um well the weather it's always good it's never it's never bad uh um there's always something to do it's rarely a dull moment the traffic the traffic is horrible well probably traffic is horrible in almost any major city but i hate the traffic not really i mean i have enough things going on here so if i travel it's usually somewhere that's within driving distance i studied uh business i did no i've i've been done for a few years so i haven't gone to school for a while one of these days i'll go back to graduate school but my dream job would be to just work for myself and making lots of money um i don't know i don't really have a dream job just something that i can i can work under my own terms and get paid decently and and be in a creative creative environment um i don't know i think it's just a matter of finding the right situation so right now eh it's been people are a little conservative about what they want so and how they want it so it's a little tougher than it seems <se> it should be but i don't know i think when the situation's right i don't think it's too difficult yep i work as an assistant <as> administrative assistant through a temp agency so it's just basically i get sent out to do uh to do desk jobs  um yes and no i mean i feel like i feel like i could do more but you know it works so  you know yeah i'm pretty close i mean they're around so um god really mad stupid people just basically doing just doing anything to annoy me um that's basically <ba> that's the big thing just just irritating stupid people <laughter> who just do things just to provoke provoke me for no reason at all um what's a good example just random people who who think it's funny to just sit there and get a rise out of me just it doesn't have to be one any specific situation it's just people who just think it's funny to i think they're just generally sadistic and they just think it's it's funny to to just prod you like it's like poking a stick at an angry dog knowing that they know how to they just wanna push your buttons for no reason so uh god i don't remember i with those situations i usually try not to remember <laughter> when when it happens i just i just let it go and just like the past is the past i just tend not to look back what do you mean okay god what do i do to relax i like to run i like to go to the gym listen to music i have a lot of musician friends so i just so i'm usually around musicians so anything of that sort i like i like everything from punk rock art to tattoos to just anything that's that's generally art and creative who's been a positive <pos> i think it's just friends in general who who seem to who seem to do well and i think they they're very inspiring and which is sometimes a a bit tough in in a town like los angeles where i think everybody's on the go trying to accomplish their own goals so they don't it's sometimes hard to find someone who's gonna be uplifting or try to be inspiring so i don't really have anybody in particular but people have kind of brought up things here and there you know just like hey instead of instead of doing this how about doing that or hey you're good at this why aren't you doing that or something like that just you know i'm always looking for new opportunities so they always point out things that maybe i might i could do differently instead of just being negative saying hey don't do that that's no that's why are you doing that it's a waste of time um i guess it depends on who you talk to i'm i'm okay at it i could probably work at that um i don't know i mean i can i i think i can do better at it well back to the point about people provoking me so i mean i try not to blow steam and let them get under my skin so i just usually try not to let it get to me but i don't know i guess with temper i guess it depends on how i handle my stress lately i've been better at it just because i think my situation's been a little bit better no no no um nothing major i mean maybe when i was younger i could've traveled more or i could've worked towards something that paid better job-wise but i mean those are all things that i think at any point in life you always think like well i coulda shoulda would've done but you know but then again i think that's natural for anybody i mean i could i could've become a banker or i could've become a lawyer or a doctor and made about ten times the money that i make now but but then again i don't like the law and i don't like medicine so so i'm it wasn't meant to be so yeah so um i think i think my in my life i knew that i there's a lot of things i have <ha> there's more dislikes <laughter> than likes so i kinda narrowed it down to what am i good at and what am i not good at and what am i gonna work well or who who am i gonna work well with and who will i not work well with so i kind of i kinda sorted out and then the list kind of mmm kind of answered itself so no it i don't think it was hard but it was just but i think it was a real reality check and i think it it's kind of a good thing 'cause sometimes trying to conform to doing things that doesn't really fit you doesn't make sense it's like trying to shove a a round peg into a square a square hole and it's like it just no matter how you try to shove it in it's not gonna go in so sometimes it's just might as well go down a path that seems to work better for you memorable experiences um hmm i think it's just i don't really have like any one in particular i think i think every day is almost like a memorable experience whether it's positive or negative i think it's just everything from getting it just just the fact that i got a job and i can i can take care of myself is already almost like a memorable experience maybe for the average person it it sounds stupid but you know i think just the fact that i'm able i'm able to get this far in life without like completely self-destructing is already an accomplishment so i feel like i've gotten somewhere maybe not to not maybe not to the point to the average person they might think like well why aren't you a millionaire but you know what not everybody can be a millionaire yeah um when was the last time i really felt happy um i don't know i'm not really someone who's like i don't have any real high highs or low lows i mean i haven't hit any lows so i mean i i don't know i'm usually pretty i feel like i'm a level person and i'm pretty happy <ha> every day i feel like if i accomplish one thing then i'm pretty happy so i guess to answer the question probably mmm probably yesterday i just feel like if i if i'm able to accomplish something then then hey i'm happy i don't know i don't really have a best friend but i mean i well to answer the question generally friends i think they would say that i'm very <ver> pretty outgoing i'm pretty determined i'm trying you know i try to you know i try to interact as much as possible i'm always out networking as much as possible so i don't know i guess that's basically what i think they would describe me as okay no problem alright bye,0
302,i'm fine how about yourself  i'm from los angeles california what part  okay  um all my family's here friends a mixture of people and a lot of things to do early childhood education no not right now but i would love to get back into it love working with kids seeing them smile um guess it goes back to when i was a kid uh i like being happy and playful so i guess it just transferred into my adult life working with kids as a school teacher or in that capacity yeah it is but if it's a passion of yours it'll always be fun i'm very close sometimes too close um i have four sisters and one brother on my mom's side and on my dad i have six brothers and four sisters and we're all getting intertwined together so so that's why i say we're too close sometimes no i have a lot of friends to interact with and uh we're always doing different things so that's why i say i'm not curse <laughter> just let it out a couple days ago my nephew didn't call me back um kinda mad 'cause i had set aside some time to spend with him and he just blew it off and didn't call me back yeah i know mm i'm okay when my mother passed uh it's been about five years now to the day so it's it's getting better time makes it easier a lot 'cause there's a lot of things that make me think about her in a daily basis anything uh driving by a particular restaurant that she likes uh watching different t_v shows just anything that could trigger a a memory of my mom yesterday uh think about the good times and i don't stay in that place too long just go ahead and think about it and move on mm not officially but i think i might be depressed well i mean since my mom passed it's been kinda rough and then um job situation is not stable here in california so that has a lot to do with it as well so yeah it is but kinda sort of kinda just to myself reserved  mm not really it's pretty easy grumpy irritable fidgety just a big ball of nerves  uh what do you mean uh i guess so yeah i like to travel meeting new people different locations scenery uh different opportunities to try something new in a new location uh just came back from memphis about three weeks ago go and see family and friends uh it was pretty nice got a chance to see um something new change <cha> change of scenery wow stick to the plan and don't veer off to the left or right just go straight ahead um  just different circumstances in life that gradually pushed me towards the left and the right every day uh a few relationships not staying in school um missing out on great opportunities with employers um funny loyal spontaneous life of the party grew up together in the same community went to school together high school friends uh my big sister michelle uh my friend troy um i mean there's others but those two uh no matter good or bad they're always in my corner for me thank you yesterday <yester> yesterday celebrated a birthday oh it was just a little small intimate setting  cooked a a meal had family and friends over listened to music watched movie talked about the old days when my mom was here and when we were all one union so it was just a nice evening thank you bye bye,0
303,okay how 'bout yourself here in california yeah oh well that it's big and broad there's a lot to do a lot of um um job opportunities than other states um pretty much that it's big and there's a lot you can do here traffic um maybe the violence rate bad news even though you know you wanna know what's going on in your environment but you still have to watch it so you can you know look out to see what's going on on a daily basis sociology i have a um two year degree in liberal arts but my major was sociology no i'm actually an m_t_a bus operator well since metro is steady growing um my dream job is to move up in the company and i'm about to actually start some classes for supervisory next week so um 'cause they look to promote within the company so that's the good thing there's a lot of opportunities at metro where you can take classes and they'll pay for your tuition and things of that nature thanks well it's not actually hard as right now it's easy if you take advantage of it right now 'cause they look to promote within so you know so since i'm already working there that's a good thing so it's good to go ahead and take the classes that you need that you're interested in and go ahead and move up the ladder as soon as possible  what do you mean i'm sorry okay read take a long walk hot bath meditate just close my eyes sometimes i'm pretty much good because see by me being a bus operator you run into circumstances and situations you gotta remain calm and still remain professional at the same time well i look at it like it it goes with i mean it comes with experience you know um you do something on a continuous basis usually you some somewhere down the line you become good at it you know so i i look at it like that so i've been driving for years and dealing with the public so it's just how you handle circumstances you you know treat people like you wanna be treated no i'm pretty good at it now maybe when i was younger you know you as you get older you get wiser you learn different things and i'm still learning today i would say my family you know my kids you know even though you know i had been having a lot of deaths around me but that's just go that's part of the life experience you know you born here but you gotta leave here one day but my kids will keep me you know sane and you know i love them and my family   thank you no <laughter> um setting good examples you know because you're the first teacher you know and you wanna set a positive good example for your kids and i think that's a good thing and it starts at home well um by you being the first teacher your kids you're you're their one that they see on a daily basis when they wake up so whatever's been taught in the home they lookin' and learning every day you know whether it's a home school you know people kids have a tendency to do things what they see you know what i mean  so you try to keep it positive teach 'em good morals and values and how to get along with other people regardless of race and you know different things of that nature i have a um four and a half year old son i have a seven year old daughter and i also have a twenty three year old yeah i'm 'bout to be well my daughter's pregnant with a boy she has three um little girls so i have three grandkids and um one on the way which is a boy this time yeah thank you the hardest thing is well right now i'm a single parent so that makes it hard alone itself you know and they can be expensive at times you know it depends on the person's situation you know the whether they have help or a job you know things of that nature to help the situation better but it's hard you know but you i try to you know keep a job keep food in the house you know just maintain and support my kids the best way i can with my kids or just period what's memorable for me is that i'm the only one in my family with a degree so it's kinda like yeah it's kinda even though i'm the baby of ten kids you know and i've always kept that in the back of my mind even though everybody well pretty much my whole family have decent job but i'm the only one with a degree so i kinda like gave myself a pat on the back like you know you know i just that's the only thing i remember graduating you know and my family there and to support me  thank you happy that i accomplished something you know just even though it may not be much but it was better than just have having a high school diploma and i had um i was working on my bachelor's degree but i ended up in a bad car accident i never went back i got distracted and you know i was working at the same time but i was just like moreso i needed income than than um schooling at that time because i was a young parent you know 'cause i had my daughter at seventeen so i was like i needed the money to support her but i never went back but i feel like it's never too late so i feel like i'll take some classes now that i'm with metro to help me move up the ladder so  that's why i'm starting a class next week thank you hm well the advice i would've gave myself that i probably wouldn't have been a young mother at a young age and that i probably would've stayed in school you know not let the accident just distract me and not i would've remained in school i probably wouldn't have had kids early you know um rather i probably would've stayed in school and probably have a part time job or something just i just feel like um education is a excellent thing for a person just having knowledge and learning different things keeping your mind open to learning new ideas every day so i think that's a plus you know in anybody's shoes just to better they selves you know through education maybe to um maybe promote within your company or whatever the case may be that they help better your career i'm not quite sure um you learn from your mistakes you know but at the same time you don't continue to make the same ones i feel like it's okay to make a mistake but long as you do something to change you know um like myself even though i'm going to school late but still i'm going you know i wanna better myself career wise so  yes my oldest daughter we had a argument because just the life that she's living right now and the things that she's going through and um i had told her that she just needed to make some changes to better her situation and uh we got into an argument because you know how your kids sometimes don't wanna hear it you know hear the stuff that you're saying even though it's true or  or they just you know well they just don't wanna hear it you know they may be going through something they don't wanna hear but we got into a argument about it but that just happened you know i just told her i'm not i'm sorry very close very close it's just that the the situation my daughter's in she just needs to make some changes to better her her life and I'll be telling she's um she's kinda like stubborn in her own way you know i was raised to listen to your mom you know your mom's not gonna tell you nothing wrong and i've been telling her over the years you know different things and it's it's kinda like i was talking to a wall because she she did the opposite and now she's she regretting it you know 'cause she's like my mom told me this you know mom i'm doing the opposite so i guess she gotta bump her head a couple of times to get it it's kinda like i done told you i done left it alone and now it's up to you to make the change it's very frustrating because it's like i'm talking to a wall and she's not hearing me and i'm like it seem like it's taking forever for her to change but it's left up to the individual whenever they're ready you know what i mean once the person get tired of something they'll make it change it may not be when you want it to happen but the ball is her court you know i only can do so much oh wow i have my days um since i have two little ones um i kinda like trained them to go to bed at eight o clock because you know they gotta go to school and i think it's important to have a good night's rest because it kinda like <clears throat> it it kinda like gets you ready for the next day or you know how you gonna feel if you rested what type of person you'll be that day you know 'cause everybody have they days whether they're good or bad but that's just a part of life and i feel like if you had a good night's good good night's rest hopefully you'll have a good day you know pretty much you know i need my rest because i'm out there driving that bus and dealing with all these people and you know  the job itself if very stressful so i feel like if i'm rested it'll help me what am i like irritated tired um lazy you know feel like i wanna lay down probably go to sleep <laughter> get the rest that i need but <laughter> i never thought about that i just you know 'cause like i said you know everybody have their moments they do i never thought about that hm no no i don't really have a best friend but a person that i deal with and i used to work with um she would probably tell you that i'm very um outgoing a go getter dependable responsible i'm a um people person i get along with others you know i'm kinda like um i leave a good a a good mark whether i know you or not if you was to you know like  like you and i now you know i um you'd probably say oh she seems like a nice young lady or whatever you know something like that thank you well i try to stay happy i'd rather be happy than sad my kids keep me going you know what i mean especially when i go to pick them up from school or their being hey mom you know that just kinda make my day just them run up to me you know and be happy and excited you know what i mean  thank you you're more than welcome you have a good day goodbye,0
304,i'm doing good um from los angeles california um the cool weather the beaches the people the schools  um child development yes to be a teacher for special education it's not hard 'cause i love to work with children yes dishonesty maybe um like if a guy like especially when it comes to relationships when they lie to you about something that's very minimal my mom i wanna say my mom um very close we talk every day very close even though i don't live with them i try to see them as much as i can uh it's okay <laughter> it's it's good it's yes i do  um they're they're friendly it's just that they're very quiet 'cause i'm not used to that environment it's fine like the how much it costs is very cheap so that's good and they're friendly so it's fine I just wish it was a little bit it could've been better so yeah  yes <laughter>  um i had a different option to live with somebody else and i'm still friends with the female and comes to find out that we connect more than the roommates that I live with so I kinda regret moving in with the roommates I have now versus who i was supposed to move with in the beginning so but i'm stuck for a year so it's whatever  that's fine how do i know who i yeah <laughter> there's nothing that really gets me really mad that i can think of the top of my head um um maybe when it comes to schools how they treat the children especially children of color maybe  that really gets me mad mm yes  because i do things from within i guess so um internally motivated to do things i guess yeah yeah wow i hardly ever argue with somebody <laughter> yeah oh my sister i guess my sister that was about a month ago uh i felt very betrayed and belittled because she's my little sister and she shouldn't be disrespecting me in any type of way because i'm an adult so yeah i was not feeling the situation at all um just her getting into grown folks' business and it was a conversation between me and my mother and i guess she overheard what was being said and she felt like through my actions that i was choosing somebody else over my family when that wasn't even the case but because she didn't know the whole situation she just automatically assumed and put stuff on facebook about me disrespecting me calling me out by name and it was just yeah so <laughter>  and she then comes to me about it like she did all this other stuff on facebook i don't that's one thing i don't like either is when you i hate indirect comments like if you have if you need to talk to me come directly to me don't put it on facebook tell other people that's a pet peeve of mine so i really don't like that yeah so but i mean we're fine now so that's good yeah to not  believe people so easily so gullible to not be so gullible i guess i've been hearing that lately how i believe anybody anything that somebody says without really thinking about it or without having them prove it so i guess you could say i let i made a lot of mistakes i don't wanna say i regretted it because i'm glad i went through it while i was younger than me getting older and going through the same situations so um yeah i believe people too easily and i give people too much chances  so yeah when i went on a cruise which was a happy experience when i went on a cruise to mexico with my family um  when i was sixteen about six years ago yeah <laughter> yeah i mean yeah i guess it was <laughter> no i really want to though um trying new things seeing new views of the world um trying the different type of foods um seeing how the government is and how they run the things out there i guess um yeah i plan to go to the bahamas next year i plan to do a lot of traveling next year actually so yeah it's pretty good eh somewhat i'm tired <laughter> and i kind of fall asleep during class and whatnot yeah it's my fault though um probably today yeah well i fell asleep late so <laughter> it's my fault um no i feel pretty happy right now mhm no no no very friendly and funny talkative um through high school  we're pretty close we try to talk as often as possible maybe once a week i'll try to see them at least every few months mm they're everywhere <laughter> um yeah no comment on that they're more smarter they are learning more stuff than we learned back in the day they are learning they're very progressing but when it comes to technology they're not outside they're always on the computer on their phones they don't play outside no more they don't care about nature or the little things in life they just yeah but when it comes to their mentality they argue smarter 'cause the schools are getting better i ain't gonna lie so  when what happened i was just okay um last weekend i guess right now um  what did i do um being with my boyfriend makes me really happy so i was just hanging out with him last weekend and i never really get to see him that much so yeah   'cause he works i have school different schedules it's not that bad <laughter> um he's my boyfriend i've been knowing for what about six months now  we met through a mutual friend um  in l_a i guess okay you're welcome bye,0
305,i'm doing alright uh originally i'm from california uh born in glendale i'm not too happy with it uh just unemployed at the moment but uh actively seeking uh uh doing what i'm supposed to be doing uh there are some uh  some prospects there but hopefully i'll learn something today yeah well i have one it's a girlfriend so i consider her a roommate a lover type thing pardon me um we're pretty close uh i met her last year and uh we've been through some troubling times but uh we're starting to see a light at the end of the tunnel uh the troubling times uh i would let me see uh well i had uh gotten a d_u_i last year and uh lost my job i'm a truck driver by trade so  uh that kinda threw me way off uh having a fourteen hundred dollar a week job uh and then going to nothing kinda like plus losing my my license kinda really threw me off and uh I couldn't um i haven't really uh found anything that i was interested in uh so i started cooking and our trying to see which other route i can go as far as uh having some kind of a career and uh so i'm choose choosing to go into the culinary field but you know uh meanwhile i still have to work it's hard to find work with uh without going to school  and uh so but i think today uh i applied at ralphs so hopefully i'll get that job i should have that job actually so um but i'm starting to see a light like i said at the end of the tunnel now a little by little my dream job would be probably forestry service out in the wilderness yeah i like being alone pardon me well you know i have a a lot of for animals i'm an exotic animal trainer by trade and uh so and i like  being i don't like people too much uh so being outdoors and uh i've always enjoyed being outdoors that's how i like being a truck driver i've traveled the world i don't necessarily like being in a warehouse or an office i'm of a a outdoors type of guy so uh one of my trips would be uh i spent a year and a half in japan and uh on the uh lower island uh there that uh they built that bridge  uh the largest bridge in the world uh and uh i went there to work for  uh for an all white oh uh an all white tiger act and uh working for a japanese circus  so it was interesting that a lot of people on that island hadn't really seen a lot of americans  'cause that was also one of the islands that we uh that they bombed  so there was a lot of negativity but i i pretty have a good idea out you know outlook uh on life uh especially during those times you know i i enjoyed myself you know through all the traveling and and meeting new people and um eating you know different um diverse foods and uh it was a good experience for me  all of that whole experience was pretty good for me you know just traveling around with circuses and uh  you know it's been great uh probably um one some of the things i like about l_a there's not a lot that i like about l_a but um i like hollywood i like the the the movie industry um the uh huge uh um different different people you know different uh different ethnics of uh people here you know uh i enjoy talking to uh few you know a lot of foreigners you know i like to see where they came from and and what what it's like there  traffic's atrocious you know traffic <laughter> uh ignorance uh being disrespected uh being disrespectful or whatever you know other people being disrespectful toward you or other people um that's about it dishonesty pardon me uh it happens on a daily basis it seems like you know i ride the bus a lot so uh you know or i if i'm riding my bike uh people tend to almost run me over so if i'm not totally paying attention to traffic uh you know i find myself sometimes you know having to wait to see what they're gonna do instead of i having the right of way or uh something like that yeah big time what do i do when i'm annoyed um probably sit there and uh sit there and vent you know uh speak my mind even though a lot of times it's i'm myself you know just like you know assholes or whatever you um well you know i carry rocks in my back pocket so i can it you know it happens so much where i i just it just amazes me at what people will do sometimes you know you almost get run over all you know i i probably almost get run over probably on a daily basis   and if i wasn't paying attention i'd be up shit creek uh it's hard with dealing with people especially trying not to react 'cause there's consequences for your reactions um it was with my girlfriend and uh it was about being honest uh  um i'm pretty honest with i'm open and honest about any anything and everything and uh what it was about was uh just her lying to me uh telling me that she had told our landlord something and and that she had done something and that and that aspect and i come to find out a week later that it was a total lie so i just you know didn't like that at all pardon me um i'm trying to i'm missing the word for it uh just that i don't know now that whether i could believe anything she says now so it was it was uh i felt hurt you know uh that you know here we had been in a relationship for a little bit and well that's probably one of my biggest uh pet peeves is is being honest  um i don't like i said i don't hold back and i'm pretty honest in anything and everything that i do or say so you know and if you're lying about something well you just you're always having to cover up uh more lies with the lies that that you already told and i just don't see any you know so it kinda took a lot from uh me trusting her now or you know whatever now i'm i you know is it truthful is it not you know so it's kinda hurt our relationship can't do nothing about it uh fun i like going to the beach uh i love shooting darts but i haven't done it in a while i i love i love to paint uh i got into watercolor painting  and i'm pretty gifted at that and um uh i wanna try some other mediums and uh let's see here i love fishing uh haven't gone in a while though and uh i like driving a truck you know uh it's you know my job you know i was a i really really enjoyed it i don't like driving through cities but uh usually when i'm in the middle of the night where i can see all the stars i like star gazing i'll see if i can um pick out some of those uh astronomy uh stars up up there and um  i'm a pretty easy going guy so shooting pool um sunshine just those i like uh most memorable experiences um good or bad uh most memorable experiences uh probably uh playing with lions and tigers uh uh wrestling a a baby elephant in a in a mud puddle uh uh just enjoying myself i know not uh i don't have much family as it is uh at least here in the states i don't my mom's from central america so uh  but i'm not close to i have uh  three brothers one sister and i'm probably not really really close to none of my siblings i speak with one brother uh quite a bit um my other youngest brother you know he he just i'd just rather not  you know i converse <con> converse with him but it's you know just i try to keep it on a professional basis my sister i don't talk to at all my my other brother underneath me i haven't spoken to him in years so i'm just close with my mom uh my niece some of my nephews and that's about it have i done anything to avoid it um to avoid them uh yeah i just don't talk to them i don't call them i don't ask about them i you know i talk to my mom quite a bit my brother quite a bit but i just don't bring up those subjects or if they are brought up i just usually say you know that's on them and i really don't wanna deal with them so um it's been hard lately it's been probably hard for the last uh going on a year um you know i uh depends on my thought process at the time i like i said i've been looking for work quite a bit um so just wondering why you know i don't get called i i just have my i have racing thoughts  so  or i get depressed you know 'cause i or i worry about things that you know that really i have no control over so i don't lately i just been sleeping a bit too much uh at least for me because i'm so used to just sleeping four to five hours a a a night but now it's changed to about eight to nine hours and i'm still tired uh lately i have been probably about the last few months um tired <laughter> um i you know if i don't sleep well sometimes then i just dwell back on the same things that have been bothering me so you know i'm more of a guy you know i love to work um and if i'm not then it's just a little bit too much time for me to spend in my own head and so you know um i there i either if i'm busy or i'm doing what i you know in whatever job i do i kinda you know get to it i enjoy it uh it's something new for me and uh so i can think about you know either work or i think of home and then think about this you know i don't have to worry about you know um money um you know bills are getting paid and i can just concentrate on other things either you know do the things i like or mm you know maybe spending a little bit more time with my girlfriend or you know so something like that  how do i what how do i cope with them um i just try not to think about it uh it's it's not about whether coping with it or not um i just do it's uh i'm more of a guy that just you know it may take me a moment to to um say that i'm coping with something but you know it it's if i have no control over it there's nothing that i can really do about it the only thing i can do is control to do what i'm doing and that's actively looking for work uh actively going out on uh  interviews uh talking with others about work so that i can just kinda you know get back to um back to basics you know i just don't let a lot of stuff bother me it does bother me but i try not to to let it continue to bother me if what has gotten me in trouble my mood swing i mean um yeah money i mean you know my past i i got a past history so uh which kinda tends to uh uh bother my uh my hiring process i don't know if i'm gonna get hired so i gotta deal with uh different different type of employers who are uh say uh felony friendly and uh uh stuff like that and i try you know i i've taken classes on uh  on uh how to interview how to uh how to answer some of the questions which you know come up quite a bit and uh i kinda reflect back on that but i just uh i gotta keep putting to my head that that's not who  who i wanna be anymore so or you know i i've done  uh i've done uh i've done my time uh so to say but uh i took the time you know the last time i just took a lot of time and  and try to uh work on the issues that were bothering me so um you know toward positive stuff i got my g_e_d different things a lot of classes um uh thought about going to school  i didn't go to school and uh anything that would kinda um change my old ways and and uh and try to move on to more productive activities  pardon me i still didn't hear you that people have been deceitful can you repeat that one more time alright uh i've been diagnosed with uh bipolarism um it's tough if you don't you know um i don't medicate so i mean i have been on medication before  in the past but <sniff> um again it's i try to live on life uh i try to live life on life's terms  and i just you know um i know the medical establishments always wanna label something and  and what i don't like about it is that they just experiment with pills you know i've been on probably every imaginable pill that there is for that and um you know some of them have been too strong or some of them not strong enough and so i just try to cope with things uh um it's just my life skills you know i i don't i don't wanna be using drug i know certain drugs work for like three to four months six months  and then they go well here i'm gonna try you on this and or i'm gonna try you on that  and it's just an ongoing process and i probably for about the last two years actually about three years i kinda just said you know what that's it and um whether it's different than whether if i would be on on on uhon meds for it   um i don't think so you know it's the still the same stuff i still get the same problems and i still  uh get the same anxiety as if i if i was on medication for it or not so i just and i'll deal with it you know sometimes it's not good you know i get irritated at people a lot i don't like people um i don't like crowds i don't you know like obnoxious people huge empty quiet so um but i i get a person you know i it's not that personality but i think people can see me and just say uh don't mess with this guy or you know um but still you know i like i i ride public transportation quite a bit and um you know you just get a lot of loud obnoxious people on there sometimes i gotta get off the bus that's how i deal with with with with people because i just know there's consequences if i if i didn't deal with it that way  so i just let it go i'd rather take the time on getting off the bus waiting for the next bus and hopefully it's not that bad  did i have a problem before i got out uh well i  i don't know if i knew that i had a problem um uh before i found out the thing is that i know other people  um i have a lot of ups and downs so i know a lot in my younger days people would tell me you know when i told them that i was diagnosed with you know bipolar that um  a lot of remarks were like oh that's what's wrong you know that's what was wrong with you we we wish that you would've would've found that out years ago  uh and uh like i don't think the meds really work but what i do uh i think uh time kinda like you know just getting older kind of uh you know makes it work you know me me dealing with life so pardon me uh i talked to a therapist probably on a weekly basis for a while uh recently and uh it helps a lot you know uh just to get out my anger uh my thoughts um a lot of people may not understand that but uh a therapist is i think the bigger thing is that i can just get it all out uh whatever's bothing me whether it be uh people you know uh uh other issues you know were whatever the case may be  i just think talking about it and they're such good listeners and can kinda like you know they they give me the same advice that you know that i you know give myself or whatever that i would give to others uh but it's always helpful if you hear it from somebody else somebody who will be has a you know are are you know they go to school for this so  you know but it's good to have yeah well i don't go anymore uh so um i kinda miss it you know like i said uh uh i miss it a lot actually but uh it's just one of those things you know i just deal with it you know uh according to you know if i ever get a chance to go to therapy again i probably will um well monetary reasons and uh you know uh i don't have health insurance there's a lot of things that you know i'd like to do but i can't you know um  you know money situation's not that great right now so how does my friends describe me um they would probably describe me as uh uh energetic uh outgoing person uh once i get to know people um laughs i you know i laugh a i laugh a lot um but uh they would probably tell you that i'm also very serious and uh  uh hidden person i don't reveal a lot you know and uh so  someone who has been a positive influence in my life someone who's been um someone who's been a positive influence in my life uh probably my boss one of my bosses uh when i first started with uh with exotic animals he was real you know he was uh uh german and um they didn't teach i don't know what he saw in me but he taught me a lot about working with exotic animals and um showed a lot of confidence in me and which in in it also built confidence in myself  and uh sort of let me know that you know that there's nothing that i really can't accomplish if i put my mind to it you know yeah it was you're welcome bye <laughter>,0
306,fine uh colorado mhm uh career career possibilities uh paralegal uh for further education for the weather for a friend [laughter]  not often at all now every few years oh the weather uh the beach sunsets at the beach uh the thought of uh career possibilities um an educated group of people sophisticated market it is an adjustment uh to to come here a lot of people misjudge it a little bit it's a laid back appearing town but it's actually very um uh sensitive to you know uh success and commericalization and that kind of thing so you have to keep up the pace uh that is a little bit harder i think when you first make the adjustment and pretty soon it becomes obvious that it's another market that you just have to work hard in like you you do in others oh be an attorney [laughter] mhm oh just because you have the uh the power you can use uh you know skills to be able to affect people live people's lives in a more dramatic way than just being uh an assistant in that field oh uh a lot of it is not around anymore just have brothers and sisters out of state so not particularly close right now uh mm dishonesty unkindness  lack of sympathy uh insensitivity you know uh very good if anything i'm i'm uh regressive that way [laughter] mhm oh wow uh oh just a friend a friend who is who is right now a has a fabulous job is uh spending too much money that he needs to save uh through uh a work situation just a a work connection  mutual friends mhm uh close close now we spend time we have uh we go out and have fun sometimes uh walk walk on the beach uh you know uh shop in beach areas is kind of fun rodeo drive occasionally and uh and see films art art galleries oh uh my daughter i just have one daughter who graduated u_c_l_a law school and uh i raised her totally alone without any help so it seemed like an accomplishment that was was worth it the the two jobs and the work uh i think it's difficult i think it's a difficult job that takes a lot more work than most people give it credit for if you wanna do it right you know it's always second guessing your behavior and that kind of thing uh just uh i'd say peer pressure it can totally alter [al] alter anything a parent has tried to put into a child that's good scrubbed_entry so that was a really bad time for us um i think it depends on which neighborhood or state you're in or the the uh i i think they're a little misguided i think a little uninspired [unin] uninspired right now i think they're being weighed down by the concerns of the wars and um and things like that and i think they can probably use a  uh a common goal a common you know now a team uh as as oppposed to just being more separated group than a family [fam] once they were i think you know kind of uninspired right now um i worry sometimes about you know work issues but it's pretty pretty easy um no i i don't feel like i'm not sleeping i i just you know will occasionally worry about something at work oh gosh about a couple weeks ago oh just uh you know unfortunately we have to worry you know i'm fortunate this isn't easier it's just cooperation between people uh it solves most everything you know so you always wanna have that around you um just stressed yeah stressed more stressed mhm um yeah fatigue has uh a lot of uh you know a lot of implications for just not feeling like yourself or misjudging things that you might judge differently if you were more well rested uh not depression um probably yeah i was that was considered a possibility i had an employment lawsuit several years ago and and uh actually litigated it and won the settlement um something about whistleblower thing implications [im] implications of that and um and i was kind of harrassed about it and so i found when i got out of it i couldn't find work right away in my own field so i had to go into a different field go back to u_c_l_a and get a new uh professional direction and i found myself fearful sometimes that it's gonna happen again you know and you think that would never happen again you know um just that i was noticing that i was noticing i was feeling very uh in my paralegal class i had a a section about employment law and there was a a very complicated filing i had done with great a deal of work and study for my case but once faced with it again in that class setting i just i just couldn't get it done it was a late paper from me and i realized i was traumatized by having to go through that again um that you know yeah post traumatic stress sometimes comes later after the adrenaline dies down from what i understand and um so i think it was just uh it was just hitting me later you know that i was having to face that paper again and wow you know no adrenaline just wow there is a xxxx back back just uh just extreme uh you know avoidance of getting something done that should've been easy for me  and uh and thinking about it as thoroughly as i should've or studying it or putting it off uh putting the feeling of going through that paper that type of paper even if it's just a class assignment again you know well um not lately um you know back then for sure when that happened which was about ten years ago now it was settled in court about seven years ago now and uh yeah it was it was effective you know it was effective in the way you view most everything and in your confidence and that kinda thing i'm sorry [laughter] repeat the question uh peaceful do i feel peaceful well yeah i was peaceful that it that it's settled uh but but angry that it ever happened so it's hard to i'll probably not ever feel peaceful about that issue ever it always the mention of it always makes me angry that i had to go through that yeah i don't think so i tried everything to avoid it [laughter] you know and so uh uh i think that's that was aggravating for me too because i'm a patient person realistic and um and i tried everything to avoid uh confrontation in the matter but it was just required to try to you know help me cover the damage to our lives my daughter's life i uh not now maybe one time in my life not now you if you can't communicate uh you know if you could communicate you could overcome people's perceptions or their judgments of you if you can effectively explain something and and uh it will help you overcome other perceptions of yourself that others might normally have judgments for age or anything like that um well just raising a daughter extendedly you know or or uh you know just um the experience of thinking thinking that that was a after all the years that was a success her graduating from law school yeah uh just like a lot of work had a good ending uh  you know happy glad that it was fulfilled wishes or or dreams for this child were fulfilled you know that and she was able to make that success wow um [laughter] i i i tend to be kind of happy with life 'cause the alternative is gonna harm harm your you know your ability to succeed so i try to force happiness i guess in in most every situation in my life route i find something about it uh when i lost some weight recently that made me really happy i travel a little bit locally i traveled more when i was younger i really enjoyed that but just been too busy in the last few years just new places um ability to take the worries we have every day work  or concerns and kind of put them away for a while and see something new  you know kind of the way i'm going back to uh colorado san riosco went through vale  and uh and spent the night there and um and it was just during spring when there aren't many skiiers and it was just beautiful and very quiet a lot of restaurants with the decks and open in the mountains and it was beautiful yeah wow uh just um ardent i'm hard working loyal uh um creative um just seeing something that you're creating you're trying to create uh becomes something you hoped the picture would be you know if if that's the case you know just hard work uh just fulfilled or or presented itself in a certain way that you know it makes you happy to my daughter um very [ver] pretty close she just had a baby she's in the bay area she send me pictures all the time okay bye,0
307,<laughter> um moscow um my family moved to the u_s and then i moved down here eventually for college  uh it took a long time to i've been living here for about a year since i graduated so there's been a lot of ups and downs but finally gotten adjusted to it so it took a while though it goes off and on i have two roommates and there's always a little bit of drama here and there between the girls but for the most part after a year and a couple months i think we finally learned how to live together but it was pretty much like a reality t_v show for a while one's from college and the other one we found on craigslist it varies depending on whether or not we're mad at each other so um i guess pretty close right now we're kinda distant oh about the distant okay um well we  haven't seen each other we haven't hung out in like two weeks 'cause one of them got into like this car accident and um so she's been distant since then and kinda locks herself up in her room and the other one is always working late so we just our our scheduling has been off and no one's really made an attempt to hang out with anyone so it's kind of we're just waiting for someone i guess to make the first move  it's okay it'll get better it depends with whom  i'm dealing with i guess i would say with some people i guess with my family not very good my boyfriend it's not very good but with other people that i might not know so well then i'm able to control it a little bit more but it'll be more passive aggressive than like full on anger oh 'cause i don't want them to see me as a bitch [laughter] yeah uh probably my best friend nicole she's probably been we've been best friends for like god since high school freshman year of high school is when we first met so long time so yeah um of of what  uh my friend nicole um we met in french class freshman year of high school we were in the same class and then we kinda started doing homework together and we had a lot of class the same classes together and so we just kinda started hanging out and then we just became closer and have stayed really close since then mhm um uh going out with friends going to bars going dancing biking hiking staying active um going to the movies going out to eat at restaurants uh photography um just hanging out with friends i guess whatever uh it varies like i'm really close to them when it comes to things about like school work um those kinds of things but when it comes to relationships and friendships and more personal personal things  i don't really discuss that with them so i guess superficially close but i rely on them a lot so we're close i guess mhm uh that's a good question um i guess it depends who it is again i guess people who are inconsiderate unthoughtful flakey ignorant and uh conceited [cons] uh yeah i guess those kinds of people and when people just um what makes me mad that's a good question i guess a lot of things make me mad [laughter] but it's mostly how people react to um different situations can make me angry i guess uh yesterday and it was my boyfriend and we argued because he's trying to be healthy and workout and save money  and so and so by doing that what he does is he orders pizza in so he's not saving money and he's not being healthy and so i got frustrated with him 'cause i'm constantly trying to push him to be healthy and each time he's like i'm gonna do it i'm gonna do it so he's constantly breaking promises that's another thing that makes me angry is people that don't follow through about other people or about myself or angry xxxx [laughter] um angry i guess i'll go with that no i don't feel angry often dang it that is a tough one how 'bout just getting paid to be me um i don't know that what i'm kind of trying to figure out right now 'cause i quit my full time job 'cause i hated it it was just mostly sitting in an office all day which i thought was extremely boring so now i work in a restaurant job and i'm trying to look for a second job to support myself um  my dream job i don't know what it would be but i know it would involve people and i'd love to have some kind of like finished product or some kind of accomplishment towards the end i guess it's something that i realized i like to see the result from all my hard work 'cause i majored in sociology and as much as i loved that major is you realize it's a whole lot of theorizing and arguing but with no real solution so it's just like at the end all you have is just these theoretical elements that you can't really do anything with and nothing to show for your work except for a piece of paper with your essays or notes so something to do with people and maybe something artistic i love photography i love cooking baking in particularly so i don't know something in that realm i guess i used to travel a lot my family is known for traveling we've gone to gosh seven eight different countries i've lived in three or four different countries i haven't traveled a lot lately just because i have no money and jobs kinda tie you down but i would love to have that i guess my dream job would be a photographer that for national geographic that would be awesome um or a huge photographer that travels that'd be awesome too but anyways um yeah i do travel a lot in the new places new faces new experiences i get restless very easily so it's nice to constantly be on the move and see different things and see different cultures and types of people and just not get stuck in the same routine i hate the routine and mundaneness of everyday life so it's nice to stir things up oh gosh okay um i'm trying to think one of my trips i guess we can talk about i don't know it's funny even though i've been to lots of different countries one of my most memorable memorable trips is one of the trips that i took with my family i was a three week roadtrip with my family there's five of us packed in a tiny little station wagon i know needless to say it's like when you're that close proximity for three weeks camping you start getting on each others' nerves but it was really fun and like even though i've traveled so many places i realized that there's like such a beauty in the american landscape and so we were all around the southwest and the grand canyon to zion to the grand tetons to yellowstone and it was absolutely amazing just seeing all that natural beauty so um and we saw a grizzly bear black bear lots of bison a wolf and it was really cool those kinds of i don't know natural wonders also really amaze me 'cause those things aren't man made and as as pretentious as it sounds after a while europe kinda gets not old but it's like you know you get the same idea like white old white men building great buildings and art work and it's beautiful and all but like you just kind of like okay i wanna see something that's natural and beautiful or something that's different too cool um pretty easy as long as I get well no i always sleep so easy oh grumpy and just very lethargic and just low energy don't say much and just kinda off in my own world i not not anymore i usually get enough sleep and i've been working out more so it's kind of  energizing me so no it's not too bad that's good uh i guess i've just been more negative but it has to do with like circumstances kind of like uh it's been about five months since i quit my full time job haven't found anything else haven't really found anything else i'm interested in so it's more of just like ugh what am i doing da da da that kind of thing yeah it's it is hard the market and just like i'm very picky 'cause i don't wanna just sittin in a little my own cubicle 'cause i quit my job exactly for that reason so why go back to another job just do the same exact thing that i quit my other job for so it's just like i have to make it worthwhile that i quit my last job to get a better job so it's just kinda like i'm stuck in this section of just like living paycheck to paycheck barely making it and just waiting for the right opportunity to come across but it's like when do i give up and sell my soul and go back to the corporate world of sitting in little cubicles i don't know yeah it is hard but i mean i guess everyone goes through that same situation after college so but i guess it's tough 'cause a lot of my friends 'cause i went to a pretty good school and you know i have a friend who's teaching english in afghanistan and i have another one who's met the president you know and one that's doing teach for america another friend who's in harvard uh school for like harvard masters [mass] you know getting her masters so it's kind of like ahh all that comparison and then here i am working a little restaurant job so uh i do sometimes yes but i'm going to hawaii next week so right now i'm fine [laughter] yes but yeah usually it's been kind of like down because i'm just trying to find like what i'm supposed to like you know what do i want to do next and like money situations which is very stressful especially when you have school loans to pay off insurance rent car loans like it's just groceries like i can't even afford groceries so it's just hard to like live this way especially after you've paid so much money for like an amazing college education so it's a little bit frustrating but there's a lot of people in the same situation it's all good uh no i don't think so but i mean i think everyone goes through depression here and there so i don't know if you can but not like medically diagnose i'm not on meds nope nope oh let's see uh to try lots of different things and not be afraid to fail 'cause i'm one of those people if i'm not gonna be the best at something then i'm just not gonna try i accept the best or nothing at all go big or go home so but i think i would've told my high school self that go and try lots of things even if it means i'm not gonna be the best at it so ten years ago well that would've made me like twelve so  [laughter] um i used to do a lot of things i i used to act i think i would've continued doing that i used to write a lot when i was younger i used to write miniature like little stories  short stories for my parents all the time and i kind of stopped doing those things 'cause it's like oh i'm not good at it so i'm not gonna do it and i think if i just continued doing those things and tried you know different classes  um i don't know different sports i kinda just stuck with soccer growing up i don't know just expand myself more rather than like find something i'm good at and just stay with it but never really try harder kinda just like stay i always kinda stayed at one level but once i'm good i just stay for good i don't try to go above that if that makes any sense uh right now it's super lame but i watch t_v [laughter] but i used to read a i used to read on my off time or just listen to music or just take a nap or bake but now it's just like since i'm on my feet all day and like constantly interacting with people i just kinda wanna unwind by like sitting and lying on the couch and being like i'm done so [laughter] that's a tough question um probably the day i got accepted into pomona college um i was a freshman at wellesley college which is the women's college back east and i hated it from like the second from like the first week i just knew that i chose the wrong college and i was like miserable for the entire year and i only only applied to one school to transfer pomona college like that's out in claremont and um i didn't think i was gonna get in and i was 'cause it was like a four percent acceptance rate and i was like what are the chances like this is ridiculous i don't think i'm gonna get in and i was like you know the thought of going back to wellesley was super depressing  um but then i got an email from one of the admission counselors that i had met when i was visiting pomona and he was like hi tatiana like um just wanted to see if you had any last minute questions about pomona hope all is well and i was like why would he be emailing me the day we find out if we got you know accepted or not um unless i got the acceptance and so sure enough a couple hours later i got the email that i was accepted into pomona and i was ecstatic that was like that best day of my life i was so happy that's probably one yeah it was awesome then i took my mom and my little brother out to dinner and i went and bought myself some new dresses went and just like went crazy dyed my hair pierced my nose i was like let's start this whole thing over so [laughter] yeah bubbly  fun  maybe moody you never know what you're gonna get sometimes um probably   uh definitely friendly um and pretty like a positive person um but sometimes maybe a little bit aggressive but for the most part i think positive things i mean she's my best friend so [laughter] huh  really happy oh when i was in mexico over winter well no i don't know my boyfriend took me on a sailing trip down in  san clemente

309,<laughter> <laughter> yeah <laughter> <laughter> i'm doing good  <laughter> uh arizona uh because of acting and other stuff like that entertain <entertai> enterainment industry no not at the moment at least um currently <curr> uh currently a student uh i produce hip hop uh well i rap and produce hip hop i play video games and then hang out with people no not very good i break things  uh on the way over here my mom and how to get here the beach <laughter> it's a fucking computer dude uh no the last place i went was los cabos <cabo> no not los cabos uh fuck where'd i go somewhere in mexico no no yes uh like four years ago right now no lately not very easy no just lately uh well my wife left like three weeks ago and after that i haven't been able to sleep uh i don't know i just bury me head in stuff i don't know i just do stuff i try to keep my mind off of it like do yoga and other things to keep my mind off of everything i don't have i never went to therapy wait no i did go to therapy like three four years ago 'cause i went to a separate therapist but then i went to a a thing where i they they did a bunch of uh cognitive tests <te> tests and memory tests and then she diagnosed me with a type of depression that lasts for a long time like i get depressed and it last for months on end yeah uh to be honest i don't know i think it's more about like you focusing on yourself and like i don't know i don't know how to explain that it's like you have to figure out things within yourself you don't need someone else to talk to well originally when i went to a therapist i was court ordered now i wanna go to therapy for my anger management though i don't know what the fuck <laughter> i mean my wife left like three weeks ago so yes <laughter> uh it's probably the hardest thing i've ever done so yeah well considering i'm only nineteen if i could go back nineteen years i would say not to fuck up and let myself get depressed about certain things that would've drove away my wife and not to be angry yeah driving away my wife <laughter> yes many many things every day <d> every day well i could've not broken stuff and i could've uh stopped uh like i was basically blocking out the external universe and i was putting everything into myself and like focusing on other things so that i don't focus on the real life i was basically escaping and so in that sense i wasn't paying attention to her and that's basically why she left i mean that and being angry 'cause like both contributed their own proportion their own portion earlier today uh i mean i feel really happy all the time and then it just like goes away it's like back and forth like one day i'll one second i'll be really happy and then another second i'll be really sad 'cause i'll think about something again and it's like i gotta keep my mind off of things and like move forward and like think and i don't really know how to explain it it's just something you feel no <laughter> you need better programming <laughter> <laughter> uh silly uh i'm creative uh uh potential of intelligence  i'm charming i'm loving at some points i'm all of those things some points i'm not doing yoga and playing video games and having my wife around my hip hop i mean kid travelier you need better programming <laughter> kid travelier is my friend  to be a hip hop artist  i don't know i just thought it one day not hard anymore i mean it was hard while i was practicing when i was younger when i was like eleven or twelve now it's just easy i'm still in school no problem yeah have a nice day bye bye,1
310,yes it's okay <laughter> fine <laughter> i live in hollywood uh seattle <laughter> uh it's kind of a vague question um <laughter> just needed a change of scenery uh i like traveling by train it's not my favorite thing uh because i don't fly i i can't stand airplanes so i prefer trains yeah <laughter> uh what uh flying on an airplane <clears throat> mm probably december of nineteen eighty six or eighty seven <laughter>  <laughter> uh it's nothing uh much to tell really my usually i just go from l_a up to seattle then up to vancouver that's probably the main thing i do so took the train <laughter> uh not very often so once every five years or so so oh yeah sure absolutely yeah  uh depends on what it is that i'm annoyed by could be anything depends <laughter> it depends on whether it's uh a something or a someone you know eh if it's a someone i mean i'm i don't i don't uh i don't get physical towards them but i mean i've <clears throat> depends on what they've done to piss me off i mean i'm certainly not above uh shouting at them for whatever reason so just depends uh in terms of lashing out at other people physically i don't do that but in order to let off some aggressions if if need be i'll i'm not above you know punching a wall or punching something nearby i just i mean i'm not trying to you know just as long as it doesn't physically hurt me but but i i you know just get some steam let off let off some steam well that's normal for me uh <sigh> face to face uh <sigh>  mm can't remember it's been a long time eh but i mean eh but i argue about with people online about stupid shit yeah and that's that's normal shit but as far as like face to face you know it's been a long time and <clears throat> currently or or overall which one i mean someone i'm in contact with now or someone from maybe from my past or which is it <clears throat> <laughter> okay uh my mom had a uh uh a boyfriend when i was a teenager he was like a father figure when i was about fourteen so he was a pretty positive influence <laughter> not at all to uh open up a record shop yeah uh i'm an unemployed office worker right now <laughter> as in what doing what be more specific <laughter> <sigh> going on a first date with a a girlfriend back in uh two thousand seven when we first met uh <clears throat> just made arrangements to meet her and her daughter and her daughter's friends at the queen mary in long beach and uh you know i had to cement the evening to cement the day and evening together uh hanging out and eating dinner and just ate at their hotel and yeah just got to know each other that way so  yeah it was yeah uh well we were that was the beginning of a relationship at the same so that was that's how i knew her you know she was my girlfriend at the time so <laughter> so currently yeah i do yeah uh i don't it sucks balls i hate to have roommates it sucks <laughter> <laughter> god <laughter> mm in some ways it's okay 'cause they don't see me that much 'cause i'm not really around them and other times i i need i need to have my own space you know so uh it's difficult for me that way but we get uh get along but i i don't really see them that much and that's by design so  <cough> <sigh> uh <sigh> i like to be alone sometimes i read but just mainly i i just like to be alone maybe maybe just doing nothing so just depends no no <clears throat> no i'm sorry you repeat that no not necessarily <clears throat> very i'm a heavy sleeper <clears throat> i don't know that i would call it down but i'm not necessarily what you would call you know cheery but i don't know that i'm necessarily down yeah yeah all the time <sigh> uh mm it's hard to say i i don't know i uh i'm not sure <clears throat> mm i don't know that i'm really one <on> the one to ask you know i think you <laughter> have to ask someone else about that you know i have a difficult time answering that question  <laughter> most proud of uh that i didn't didn't fall into drugs like a lot of other other people that i know yeah hmm <clears throat> listening to music on vinyl being around dogs mm uh spent new year's eve with a friend real close friend so <laughter> not really <laughter>  <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> i'm glad i don't have any i think they're uh especially here in los angeles i i they drive me nuts i can't stand them <clears throat> uh i assume you mean post-high school um uh briefly just took basic uh what did i take uh just general studies i from what i remember i i i i actually didn't finish i quit to uh uh go play in a band so i i i skipped a lot of school so i didn't really <laughter> you know so nothing uh it was a junior college <coll> or community college so it was i didn't go to university so i was just do what stop going i just wasn't interested <laughter> my interests were elsewhere so i just i just quit going you know so in terms of what oh sure everyone has regret over something you know i'm i'm not gonna get specific but yeah sure i <laughter> there are things i regret sure <clears throat> mm twenty years ago what was that ninety three oh mm well ten years ago uh two thousand and three hmm it's hard to say it's hard to say gonna <go> have to have to come back to that one maybe oh i don't have a best friend these days <laughter> i think it depends on your definition of friend uh i don't uh <clears throat> i don't hang out with too many people you know i had <ha> i had best i had a so-called best friend you know but that was like no <laughter> twenty year twenty some odd years ago you know i don't really i'm very much a loner these days so i i don't really have what you would consider a best or really close friend you know eh i just don't have that <laughter> okay see ya <laughter>,0
311,yes okay uh when'd i move to l_a um moved here a long time ago to live to go to work um well arizona and colorado i don't uh money don't have the money for it l_a's much nicer um <sigh> the people the movies uh the ocean uh when you wake up in the morning there's seagulls instead of birds just you know regular birds uh the roads <laughter> the roads really have a lot of potholes <laughter> <sniffle> yeah so it it wasn't hard to get used i i didn't like arizona at all it's really nice in l_a no what i do now um i sleep eat walk my dogs that's about it what'd be my dream job um i don't know uh screenwriter i guess um i understand it's pretty hard to write a good screenplay yes uh very well <sharp inhale> um well i didn't argue with a real person yes i have a person that i hear once in awhile and i talk to them and i had an argument about them listening on my phone uh avoidance whatever annoys me um being homeless yes it was um well they don't particularly like homeless people in l_a so it was <wa> it's really hard if you're homeless oh right now i live in an apartment uh i don't i don't like the neighbors um well they they harass you all the time so i don't come out of the apartment so <laughter> <sigh> uh well i didn't know when i moved there that they were horrible people so and i've complained to management but they don't do anything about it they just tell me to move yes um back in the nineties uh crying all the time yeah yeah uh yes yes i was in the hospital um uh two months ago for fifteen days um i was in there for depression for arguing with uh a person that's not real i ignore the person when i hear them and uh it's not hard anymore it was before i was going to therapy oh it's helped me uh be more cheerful and uh ignore things that bother me uh sleeping all the time eating too much uh tie arguing screaming at this unreal person um before i found out no uh lately i've still been pretty depressed yes very hard well i wake up about every two hours to go to the bathroom and um or i uh something wakes <wa> some noise wakes me up so i don't sleep well and i'm tired all the time mm don't remember um ah spending time with my dog or dogs i have two dogs so mm can't think of anything uh i try hard uh i have no idea <laughter> i don't know yeah uh my kids i have two kids a girl and a boy um the kids <laughter> they're great so uh trying to get them to do the right thing uh trying to get them to stay in school no um well you try to do the right thing and um it doesn't always work out yes oh well pretty close um what do i think about today's kids oh they're just like any other kids um kids are fine so yes moving to the apartment i'm living in <laughter> so like i said i know what advice i'd give myself ten or twenty years ago um uh uh stay away from my ex-husband <laughter> so a positive influence well my daughter i think i think my daughter has she uh because she's going to graduate from college in may and so she's managed to stay in school and she has a child but she's trying to do the right things do you wanna talk about anything else <sigh> oh okay oh okay goodbye <laughter>,1
312,yes fine how about you here yes the weather weather mainly yeah the main <ma> the weather sorry not the people well some of the people stuff like that some people okay i'm cutting you off not as much as i used to um i used to be in school i used to travel a lot of places for conferences and things like that but i'm not in school right now but later on i'll get back into school and i'll travel more but right no doubt i don't i don't enjoy traveling uh that's a good question you're actually pretty good um i studied physics and aerospace engineering but physics mainly yes i am actually right now i teach community college physics and astronomy uh but i still do research in physics also because i like that type of thing and i'm going back to grad school hopefully that's why i'm nervous sometimes on the questionnaire impressive professor at a place like u_s_c or u_c or l_a or like that where the professors do three hours of work a week and the grad students do the rest you're actually pretty good at this <sigh> i there's a lot of people the the first one i guess is my physics teacher in a_p physics teacher in high school even though he led me to be an engineer instead of a physics major um he still was a very good influence he told me you know he's the first one who taught me that school was not about a grade but about learning okay i'm pretty good i think i'm single so i don't get in many arguments um but it's probably my brother about he always like to uh play a video game together i know i'm pretty old to play video games but they're actually pretty good um it's probably something like that and me getting angry at him and him trying to defend himself and me being right that's all fairly close um i see them pretty  pretty often parents i see a couple times a week they're getting older so i've been helping with groceries things like that and my brother i see  same same with him same amount <amo> same time my sister i tutor her kids my nephews uh so i see 'em about once a week also interesting yes because i spend long periods of time doing math and reading and not talking to anybody that's introverted i guess i play video games or and i work out i work out i think a lot i try to at least i roll my eyes which i've been told is a bad thing um and that's about it i think <deep breath> bad parenting basically parents are more self-centered more to themselves unlike previous generations and the kids just  do what they want because the parents aren't there for <fo> the parents aren't being parents in my personal <per> own personal opinion <sigh> um i guess scrubbed_entry um scrubbed_entry scrubbed_entry thank you i don't really have a best friend introverted remember i'm biased obviously but they are i'm really good in math i'm not really sure if you can't not saying you can't get better than me in math but thing is it's just that you get reach a certain confidence with it where no matter what it is you need to learn in math you can always figure it out um i am patient i think and i am disciplined where i can spend i can spend many hours many many many hours reading books that might not be important but they might be important so i have to do it anyway that type of thing when i a good workout  doing well in video games small little things like that um what's really happy is when my my research type thing mathematical or physics type thing when it goes well that must puts me in a mood <mo> that puts me in a good mood thank you right now it's the fact that research that i did i did make it this far research wise that's all that's all interesting um when you start off in school you read about einstein and things like that it's he's this general xxx hero particle physics and you have no idea what it is and you know it's very complicated things like quantum mechanics and you still haven't realized you're interested in that and but you're not sure if you can actually make it and eventually each step as a lot of time goes by you wish you as time goes on you can get closer and closer eventually make the goal eventually you realize you are just not as good as einstein but you are up there you can do research in physics you can add to mass knowledge in science and that's impressive that you you don't see yourself doing that when you're a kid okay um a few weeks ago when i got a good grade in a class thank you yes briefly  many years ago <ag> yes i don't know it just always growing up i always thought that was i always thought it was my dream when i was a kid that's why and i just went about doing that  um i was a national guard i think about eighteen nineteen i got commissioned at twenty twenty one and i was only in for about a year so i left at twenty twenty two yes not really i don't think it did i think it's just something that you grew up something about <abo> something i grew up already expecting to be so it didn't change me as much graduate school in physics no nope it depends if i workout really hard the night before <bef> the day the day before if workout pretty hard it's bad but if i don't workout it i don't know just eh it's hard i guess moderately  thank you yes it's okay i'm probably like i am now normal i think not as not as happy about everything  but still pretty okay i can still function no maybe slightly sorry no yes yes i have changes in my thoughts um applying to grad school again it's been awhile and slightly apprehensive happy that it's looks good but apprehensive that it might not be good and things like that what do you mean by that in case i know this is a computer but as in how hard is it to deal with these thoughts or how hard is it to go into grad school i understand okay i agree no not really probably keep doing what you're doing even though i'm not that old believe it or not um twenty years ago i was probably fifteen no no yeah yeah it was fifteen um just keep doing what you're doing i think i i was very lucky and fortunate way it worked out if i worked if it was a little bit different i don't think it'd worked out so well even though it's not perfect now i think i'm doing really well personally thank you same here goodbye,0
313,sure uh okay i guess not bad not good so so denver colorado uh to pursue job opportunities uh about two years ago uh once or twice a year uh i really like the sunshine um all the opportunities all the different kinds of people lots of stuff to do that sort of thing uh i hate the traffic i wish the seasons were more distinct and that everything costs a lot of money here pretty easy hmm i'd say uh people are rude um not having enough money uh what else mm just a lot of things are frustrating i guess <cough> i guess it depends on  what i'm annoyed about like if it's at another person or about something i did or just life in general uh if somebody like a person annoys me i'll probably let them know they're annoying me until they stop is that what you're talking about okay uh so so not not as good as i'd like to be uh a few days ago about getting paid for something i did on time uh pretty pissed off taken advantage of i like to go to the gym uh hang out with friends read write that sort of thing mm at times uh because sometimes i like to keep to myself and don't feel like showing a lot of outward emotion i have a degree in in liberal arts majored in political science no i work uh in sales hmm to own uh several of my own businesses and and have lots of money coming in from different streams i guess if that's a job uh i used to live in mexico city that was pretty memorable um let's see it was pretty different than anything i've ever experienced it was a lot of fun exposed to a lot of new things and new people  uh i was pretty young carefree good times um not recently but i have in my life traveled quite a bit um let's see i went to london that was a lot of fun pretty cool city little too expensive but definitely cool of what just anything in life um let's see uh boy that's a good question um moving to l_a was pretty memorable took me a lot of hard work to uh move here so that was memorable i would say <sniffle> <clears throat> hmm uh maybe like six months ago uh things were just going really well didn't have much stress in my life uh yeah i'm i'm easier more easily irritated and uh yell more tired more uh kind of down feeling down more not as productive uh yeah awhile ago uh hmm mm don't know exactly it's been a few years but i still feel the same as i did when they diagnosed me so i assume i'm still depressed um well i just i'm a big believer in talking to people about your problems so i just thought that would uh be a good idea so i did it and and that's what i found out oh yeah definitely um i mean it depends on what you mean by therapy like i or most people probably can't afford good therapy but just even talking to friends i would consider therapy somebody who will listen so helps you get stuff off your chest  <clears throat> thanks um well i haven't necessarily seen a therapist per se but uh when you talk to somebody who listens and you and you get stuff like out there like out of your head or whatever it it's uh it helps to destress i think hmm pretty girls <laughter>  <laughter> um i'm a good leader i'm really smart uh being able to um survive on my own in a city like this completely on my own with no outside help  yeah lots of stuff um just dumb mistakes i made when i was younger that looking back now with what i know now i probably would not have made um i would tell myself to seek out and listen to people older than me as much as possible hmm scrubbed_entry he's always good for a sort of pep talk but uh with a dose of reality he doesn't sugarcoat anything so talking to him always helps give me perspective um talented and i don't know good at stuff i'm good at a lot of stuff people seem to notice that i i guess nice good disposition funny see you later,0
314,yes quite well feel good los angeles california here mhm one of the few um native born los angelinos i uh home school my ten year old son and uh i'm a home maker i have five children and married twenty two years mhm so that's a full time job huh uh somewhat we can we went to israel about two months ago um for a pilgrimmage with our church yeah so i would say yes i've traveled a bit uh well most recently we like two months ago went to israel for a pilgrimmage we were gone about nine days and it was fabulous it was we spent the first five days in chorazine which is near the uh galilee and in a place called uh uh i mean the the name of the area is chorazine but uh we stayed in a place called adonis galilea which is a um a house for that welcomes um christian uh pilgrims as well as jewish pilgrims um i i enjoy like really the most important thing i enjoy is like meeting the people and and of course seeing the the history i mean especially israel i mean it's the  it's totally ancient but um most most i enjoy is is the the people i think to uh get a better understanding of how different cultures um live no not at all just don't i you know all my life i've always been open and and uh willing to socialize and i remember my younger brother always um joking and saying that i i would talk to anybody and i will i'll talk to just about anybody just because i enjoy learning about other people um most of the time like by the end of the day after i've cooked dinner and we've had dinner together as a family um i there's a word game on the computer that i like to play for a little while and then um watch t_v have a cocktail with my husband and just relax that's what we do and you know 'cause we have a lot going on we don't stay up too late so i like to watch crime dramas um really mad probably not a lot um i get frustrated with for example my daughter does not clean up her room almost ever so that that gets me angry but um in terms of like really um getting like heatedly angry i mean other than like little things that my children do to you know especially my oldest child who's twenty one you know he can be confrontational so other than that nothing gets me like really angry haven't i haven't haven't felt that um contributing to society helping uh helping to raise um responsible people i guess um and of course the love and the affection and the um the fun and the excitement that goes with it of all the stages that go i mean like really right now i'm in a stage where my children are either adults or teenagers i only have i have one eleven year old and the rest are all teenagers and adults so it's really fun because we're able to um talk about current events and all kinds of stuff that's going on in the world and you know have have uh challenging discussions and that sort of thing so it's it's a different level than when you're taking care of babies and you know changing diapers and that kind of stuff the hardest thing is that it's twenty four seven um you're never not a parent you know it's and so you have to accept that and that's i remember when i first with my first child um thinking you know when i brought him home from the hospital this is it i mean there's no going back you you cannot um change i mean i guess you could if you did something horrible but i mean under normal circumstances you can't change um that and it's a permanent thing and um it it it uh in some ways it takes away your freedom but in other ways it give you a different sort of freedom mhm always i'm sorry i didn't get what you said um some of the things that've been a positive influence in my life most importantly my church um and my faith uh but also my husband he's been a really um he's kind of he's very like logical thinking and very you know grounded so when if i get emotional or i get upset about something he's always we balance each other out likewise if he's upset about something i'm able to balance him out it's been a that's been a a great gift in my life um i don't i i don't think i'd be categorized as somebody with a a temper um occasionally i i occasionally i get angry but i don't like have like rarely do i have outbursts um i'm more more likely to you know to say what i feel not let it build up so with you know like my husband and i don't rarely fight like have arguments that are yelling and screaming or anything like that it almost never happens because i i like i said i'm more of a type of person that communicates on the spot so if i'm thinking something i usually communicate it right away instead of letting it build up um usually i'm arguing with my older son because he um you know he thinks he knows everything he's twenty one years old so he has the know it all mentality  and i'm just telling him that he doesn't know it all and you know as life goes on he'll learn more he's very confident and very self uh self uh what's the word self assured and so he thinks that you know everything he does is correct and he still has a lot of learning to do that's all mhm it is it can be mhm i think um that many of them are um spoiled and live in an environment of uh of instant gratification um which i think is gonna be um detrimental to the to the future of this country but um you know given that with all the technology we have there's really not any way to go back so i i have um hope that um they will i mean i think this country was built on on uh hard work and and ethics and uh hopefully our our the next generation and the the generations after that can maintain that um that standard of living i don't know if it's possible mm as loving nurturing um funny we laugh a lot and um caring honest things that uh i mean my best i have  well actually my best friend is it's two people it's two sisters that i grew up with and um we i for some years took care of their mother who has alzheimers before my parents got sick so i had a very close have a very close relationship with them still do and so um i'm considered the fourth sister so i would say that those are my best friends and and um we love each other very much it's a good relationship no no yes most mostly mm minorly depression it was more anxiety um probably um um it's probably been five or six years i mean i've had if off and on all my life but it was never diagnosed originally like as a teenager i think is when i first had started with the anxiety but um other than that i i you know so depression kind of goes with anxiety if it's not under control um but now it's under control so i have a great huh um no i think it was what they call free [flee] float free floating anxiety more of a of of uh organic um reason for it in other words there there was a chemical imbalance  in my brain i've been feeling pretty good actually the holidays were great um we had a  good family gatherings a little stressed because um we're making a big decision right now to help my parents out um my dad is really sick um and we've offered to move in with them they have a big home but we would have to do a lot of some renovation and some to help and some obviously moving around and so we're in the throws of that and um so that's a big big change but i'm looking forward to it because really don't want my parents to be alone as they get they're in their eighties so as they get closer to death i want to have my family there with them um not easy usually all of my life i think i've always i mean i'm not i've always had um at least i wake up at least once in the middle of the night um to go to the bathroom basically and uh other than that i mean no now i sleep well i mean other than that i sleep well but sometimes if i wake up like really early in the morning then i can't go back to sleep  i'll get up and maybe do some work on the computer and then go back to bed and go back to sleep idepends on what my schedule is and if the kids are have to be at the school early and there's a lot of factors yeah sometimes it does mm probably basically the same i think i might complain a bit like oh i'm tired or my body hurts or whatever you know but um i think overall probably the same my kids know i'll be i'll tell me kids oh i'm really tired and they'll understand my older daughter will be really helpful they my other daughter will try to cook dinner or something like that so you know they may pitch in a little bit more uh not really not not no not really not anything significant huh um actually yes i do i do feel like therapy is useful um well uh we had a situation with my daughter um she also suffers from anxiety and um we have had her in therapy for some time and we just recently we're about to finish a group with her that was a six month um uh group for d_b_t it's called and it's like a  it's the first time they it's the first time they're documenting using it with teenagers and um it's been really good it's been very helpful it's just all about how to live in the moment and how to you know actual physical and mental um strategies to keep your uh keep you from your mind from going crazy you know worrying about things or you know in this case some of the kids have tried to harm themselves or whatever so um that's the focus of the therapy and it's been really good my husband and i both have been going with our daughter and it's been really um really informational and really helpful i think oh my daughter was um she was in a bad way she was you know suffering a lot and we knew it and um we acted on it that's all um like really joyful and happy i would say probably when probably it would be in israel when we renewed our marriage vows in the the at the in knaan  uh so um you know where the wedding of kana took place that was really moving and beautiful um and it was it happened that our anniversary was we left on our anniversary day flew to israel so it was right at the same time it was beautiful very meaningful and other than that i would say you know like uh other joyful occasions have been you know like christmas and you know family gatherings and you know my dad's birthday turned eighty three on christmas eve you know that kinda thing so um um that's an interesting question i would say um once i get like things done that i need to do like if i'm have a lot of chores [ch] a lot of either work to do around the house or errands to run once i get them done i feel like a sense of accomplishment you know much like i mean i worked for many years in a as an administrative manager at u_c_l_a and um you know once you get a project done or you get your whatever month end stuff done or if there's a lot of different things you have to meet deadlines there's uh that feeling of like yeah i got it done you know so i think that would be you know for me the most um most recent um way of feeling good and feeling you know like feeling accomplished dream job hm i think i've already lived it i'm also a birth doula and um yeah and um so i've attended a lot of births and now i really only do it for family and friends and um it's the most rewarding thing you could possibly ask to be involved in the birth the bringing of new life into this world so i would say that's probably was my was a dream job and i didn't know it i trained much after you know i did my managerial stuff and um was awesome it is and was awesome so i don't work at at a hospital anymore actually the hospital that i worked at is now closed but um i like i said i do it for family members um i attended a friend of mine's birth by accident she uh she had had the same o_b as i did with all my children and um i came to bring food for her husband when she was in labor we were you know close friends and her labor picked up quite a bit when i got there you know she wanted me to stay she didn't want me to leave i hadn't planned on it so that was the first birth that i had attended outside of you know myself giving birth which is a whole different experience so after that i was really interesting interested in possibly study un nurse midwifery but then i discovered this thing called being a doula which is really gives you even a lot more hands on uh one on one contact with the patient which is what i like so i trained to do that at at a hospital in inglewood um about fifteen years ago 'cause my son is fifteen and he was a year old no sixteen he was a year old so um yeah and i've been um well it can be challenging in terms of hours it depends on how long the woman's in labor but uh and you know also like for me i always tell my friends and family if they want me to be their doula that i cannot guarantee a hundred percent i'm not doing it for business and that way and because of that i don't have like back up doulas that in case i'm sick or unavailable somebody else can fill in for me so um but so far it's been that all the women that've asked me i've been able to be there for some reason so the um the uh the only one that i missed was one a friend of mine from church she wanted me to go with her second baby i was with her for her first but the labor went so fast she didn't even call me [laughter]  it was in the middle of the night she was like  two hours of labor she wouldn't even if she had called me i wouldn't have been there in time [laughter] so um it went really fast but other than that you know um yeah i've been been been able to attend all the births of people that have asked me to do um in all of life or in your job uh probably my my own birth i mean my the birth of my own children um like there's an extreme sense of joy excitement relief because of course you're out of the pain and then like it's just it's just a matter of you know going forward from there but it's it's like something you can't explain it's it's just it's awesome after you give birth and i have experienced both ways i've done both um natural and my last child was via c_section so i've had both both um experiences um i with my third child i had kind of a crazy nurse she was a little psychotic but other than that we laugh about it now but when i was in labor it wasn't funny and um she she was not there when the doctor i mean it was my my third child was born very quickly after he broke the water and oof my husband was there but she was not nor was the doctor and she got in a lot of trouble because i only had like two contractions after that my daughter was born in the bed so for me it was great 'cause i didn't have to go through any of the labor but um i'm sure they weren't happy to fill out a lot of paper work after that so now would i give mysef for ten or twenty years ago um ten or twenty years ago i was probably more not as um relaxed not as um like i feel now at my age that um i i don't have the same concerns that i did then i don't worry about uh i don't worry at all about what people think about me i don't worry at all about what you know you know like my i noticed my daughter's oh mom you can't wear that because people are gonna say this i just say i don't care you know but they do because it's still in their frame of mind that that oh mom you have to dress like this and dress like that whatever so that would probably be it the wisdom that you you achieve with age that you you see how life there are so many things that are more important in life than worrying about little things what are you most proud of in your life most proud of um probably my family my my husband and my my children i mean the fact that we've stayed married that we've we're an in tact family that um my kids see every day how their friends suffer who come from divorced families or single parents and they um they actually express gratitude sometimes that we are married and we still you know we are still a family so i would say that's probably it um probably the one of my best qualities is uh being able to listen to people and being able to um not be judgmental um through the years i've had a  a lot of experience with um people with problems a lot of friends with problems people i know from church and it's just taught me that um everybody has weaknesses everybody has problems and um i don't think i'm better than someone else if you think you're better than someone else then that's usually um to me a sign that you don't know yourself well enough okay okay goodbye,0
315,alright yes okay and you inglewood california yes no uh it's okay um you mean my girlfriend and my daughter yes they're they're okay it's okay it's cool yes i do um well i'm a football recruiter so i travel uh all around the world to to sign different football players for our sports management company  uh um just the independence about it being alone being able to be free and not tied down to one to one thing you know it's great i i remember traveling to uh scrubbed_entry and take him to clubs and this and that and we're not that type of organization <laughter> yeah um dishonesty i <sigh> i don't like when people are are dishonest um that really really really bothers me and not true not honest not real um that that upsets me a lot um i tend to just try to free myself from the situation to clear my mind usually take a walk or something like that or just just just go in a room by myself and just try to clear my head <he> my head   um i'm okay with it at times um uh but i can defintely be better oh um i argued <argu> argued with my my lady a couple days ago and it was about um our daughter and some of the things she's doing in school and she she wants to raise her one way and i think i wanna raise her kind of a different way and discipline her a little more on certain situations so i think discipline <disci> discipline is a big key and the key is life and she she she was raised a little differently um i don't know just angry upset you know when you're in a argument that's what you feel so you do and say things that  that that bother you and you just you go on with it  um yeah uh a little bit <sigh> um i don't know it just <sigh> i eh just the way i feel i don't know i can't really say just the way i feel um a little a little um i don't know just um realness um honesty the truth just being straight out front um i'm pretty close um i'm pretty close with my family oh whole nother subject just they're raised different um i i think society <so> society's gonna become even wilder with <wi> the way the kids are raised and no discipline and and the things they're doing everything we we they live and everything's inflated so much to where um it it's getting to a point where it's getting out of hand i think kids these days to a certain extent are are are much wilder than i was and and generations before me and just able to do and say and the lack of respect and you know just education-wise it's just i think it's just tough times for kids and and the way they act uh it's it's it's ridiculous to me um i definitely like to watch sports uh i i like to gamble i i like to travel i like to skate um i like kind of like uh a a a guy that likes to see different sights and go different places uh like different <difft> i'm a big movie person so i like going to theatres stuff like that um i'm actually living it um i i always wanted to be in in some kinda sports industry and that's what i'm doing now i just uh my goal was to get a little higher in the ladder and and own my own sports management company um but i'm doing pretty well for myself so i am happy yeah no no no um it's okay i'd say it's pretty easy irritated tired <sigh> i don't know it's been awhile it's been awhile couple weeks ago huh what did you say no not really um i think he would describe me as a stand up guy i try to be um um a good loyal friend and and an adult i think he would describe me like that  uh school went to school grew up together i've been knowing all my friends for pretty much all my life  yeah uh very close me our our uh my friends and i are very close uh um we pretty much do a lot together still at this age  uh i'm honest um i'm loyal very loyal um i am a hard worker i think i am um to a certain extent i'm just not the average guy i'm pretty much i'm a different different breed i just carry myself and act a little different from a normal guy  i don't know just how what i was raised and how uh my dad was kinda different uh and and and he didn't go with the in crowd and i think i learned that from him a lot and and it's just it it's it's um kind of the same path i took um yes a lot of things i regret um i regret a lot of decisions in my life um yeah one um i actually let a a lady in my life go years ago that i thought was my soulmate and  we had a big argument and one thing led to another and we decided to take a break and then that that break i i started dating somebody else and i told her i'ma go my way and she go her way i think that was a big a bad decision a very bad decision yeah totally i think i could've took a step back and really just thought about the situation a little more instead of uh <sigh> being so upset and moving forward uh just upset um i tend to get upset and then my thoughts get clouded so uh mm i i need to think a little more when i'm upset uh i don't know just experience and time being you know making making up for your mistakes and and and and um being better about different decisions after you made the mistakes um <sigh> think a little harder about situations <situatio> uh about situations and and things and the decisions <dec> decisions that you make uh think a lot longer and harder before you make 'em and i think the outcome would been a little different today um my grandmother she's always been a um a a positive influence uh she's a great black woman um with a old school um ways of living so um i think i i i've added that to my life she's a great woman scrubbed_entry in baseball and um yeah <laughter> um i was a pretty good player i was a pretty good athlete growing up um i was one of the top scrubbed_entry and uh that started a future in in athletics and that's what i wanted to do so i accomplished my goals so at the time it was a great a great thing and it still is a great thing it's a great accomplishment in my life   um <sigh> accomplishments being able to if i or if i'm  have a goal or or something i'm supposed to do that week or that day and i accomplishment it always puts me in a good mood or getting my job done and i the way i'm supposed to do it in a in a timely fashion that always puts me in a good mood um being a positive role model right now um for younger kids that's in um our sports academy program i i think as i got older the thought process and um the way i look at life has totally changed and i think i a lot of kids can look up to me that i deal with now and say you know that's somebody that that is is a positive <po> a positive influence in my life oh um couple days ago my football team um we're in the playoffs made the playoffs so that

enjoyed uh listening to their problems i used to take them out for dinner and uh if you know uh i'll be i really enjoyed uh genuinely enjoyed uh talking to talking to them and um many of them were open enough to tell me about their problems and uh you know uh all my but my main goal main main objective was to get the orders for the business ooh mm you know cook um watch movies uh meet friends

close to <t> uh um with my brother and their family um it's the i mean like i tend to be judgmental and uh you know but i think sometimes that the my niece and nephew should have been brought brought up in a different way and uh you know uh and you know my <m> my brother doesn't seem to uh think along the same lines and um you know uh we have disagreements and mm you know that's the reason it is um no not at this time what do i think of what um can you can you repeat that one more time um and i still couldn't follow you okay no no uh yes about <bout> one to two years ago i was feeling down <d> uh down and i was not interested in things that i was <wa> that i was normally interested in  and uh you know i was sort of withdrawn and um the it was sh i was not able to focus on my things so i thought maybe i should go see a doctor and i ended up doing that uh no mm xxx i lost appetite i was not sleeping well and i i had difficulty um concentrating you know and focusing and uh i was not getting uh my assignments done on time uh these <the> these were some of the problems i been feeling good but uh no i don't i started doing yoga and uh you know i've been doing that for about a year and that's uh and meditation and that's helped a lot uh it's just that uh you know when i was diagnosed with uh depression i thought i shouldn't be taking any medication for it and i was looking at uh uh other ways to get over the problem and uh then i realized some of my friends were doing meditation and uh you know i got influenced by them uh it's a little difficult but uh of late i've been able to sleep uh within half an hour  there are days when it takes almost one two hours to uh go to sleep are they what can you repeat that uh no i just uh you know uh just switch off the light and uh you know keep tossing around and uh try to focus on things uh that makes me uh feel good and this and that um about <bout> three days ago what am i proud of uh i was in i i was among the top two percent in my m_b_a class and um and when i used to run my business i designed a product um that was uh working really well and uh i was happy that i was able to design something that was so useful for my business uh my my i'm thinking my friends would describe me as uh very friendly very easy to get along with  uh very focused uh very intelligent  and a good cook um albert einstein uh i mean some <so> some of some of some of his theories um you know it obviously it involves <inv> it involves a lot of deep thinking and uh the the first few times i read about him about his uh uh theories uh i had difficulty in um um really understanding that and uh that you know we it i mean when's when there when there are things that i really try to understand and i i'm not able to i and uh you know there are there are the type of people i admire listen to other people uh it's diverse um and i like the the entertainment industry  and uh i like uh yeah the fact that there are more women uh than men here <laughter> um uh there are certain areas where only spanish <spa> uh where only spanish is spoken uh you know i would like uh for all people who come to america to be able to understand english and be able to speak in english  so that everybody can participate um in l_a um i mean like i some of the things the political leaders uh do really makes me mad uh uh sometimes i think they're wasting their wasting their time our time and other countries are advancing  and um you know these <th> these guys don't get things done and you know i feel very bad about it and sometimes it makes me angry uh yeah i mean the first four years of uh obama administration i'd i think it was wasted because uh if the if congress had acted together uh eh got things done then uh you know we would <wou> mm maybe we could have uh you know uh made it much more difficult for china to catch up with us and you know the fact that china's able to do things and get things done much faster and these people still um you know uh argue and uh you know find <fi> uh find faults with each other and not get things done um you know they don't seem to realize that you know uh you know the clock keeps ticking you know they have to get things done um i mean like you know uh <laughter> one thing that comes to my mind is well you know i made a lot of money while uh you know once in los angeles uh and you know i thought it happened during christmas some ten years ago and uh that that made me very happy good music good food uh i mean the eh a party with friends that i like and uh and you know i also like cooking and i enjoy cooking with groups in groups uh those are things that really put me in a good mood um i'm very clean um i listen to people and i empathize uh try to solve their problems uh and i'm hoping they think i'm you know uh my advices and recommendations are uh worth um their time thank you so much you've been nice bye,0
323,sure  good chicago  it's cold in chicago  hmm oh i think in ninety nineteen eighty nine actually  oh very simple very easy  oh weather of course and i'm so easily located to san diego palm springs las vegas san francisco and things i like to do smog of course is bad  crime rate's higher than it should be um  and financial economic problems here  every year thanksgiving  very very much so we're a very big family  yes i do very much in fact i love flying on airplanes i love visiting new places i even like visiting different airports everyone's different  ooh let's see  i started off in pre-med haha i ended up in uh physics yes i am i teach <tea> i teach physics  and math and higher level math  well i enjoy working with kids  i enjoy teaching my mother was a teacher uh my dad was a truant officer and uh i've enjoyed it keeps you young  my dream job  my dream job would be to be a judge  yes in in the uh  youth court that would be fantastic but i should've thought of that sooner than now so i'm not gonna be able to do that  no <laughter> not at all  um i enjoy people being around people i'm very talkative at times uh  i like to do a lot of things and i'm very social when i do them  uh believe it or not i play bridge i play chess and i watch a good old old movie  ooh bad drivers  uh bad laws  politics often  when i'm annoyed  you know i really don't get annoyed that much i just let it go  it's not worth the pain and problems they could cause if i can't straighten out a problem let it go   go somewhere else  ooh always my bridge partner but that's different uh as far as anything else i don't really argue with people i i don't argue i don't like confrontation my parents of course very very much so um i had great parents  uh  my mother uh my parents met at tuskegee which is a black college and they always want me to go to a black college but of course i didn't wanna do that <laughter> uh i went to illinois so they're a very positive role model for me there's certain things that i don't do today because of them i don't drink i don't curse i don't look down on people who do but i don't have as much respect for people who do a lot of either one of those things um  i love to drive i love to travel and my dad used to always take us some place every weekend he was off we'd go somewhere 'cause we were in chicago indiana michigan some place in the area we'd go up to michigan and pick fruit or we got all our dogs from uh puppy farms in indiana that kinda thing uh i had an uncle who lived in uh wisconsin who was a dairy farmer so my dad used to love to drive and i love to drive also  mm that's a hard one  i've had a lot of great experiences uh i think the best one was uh we went for my anniversary we went to europe we went to paris and uh  we rode the orient express we went from we didn't go all the way to istanbul we went from london to venice and then flew back to paris uh    that was probably the best experience i've ever had in my life i i've never really cared for europe because there's so much here in the united stated to do and so much in america and i had been to alaska and hawaii but we said we'd do something different and we'd always wanted to go on the orient express and we did that expensive but phenomenal trip gotta do it once it's a once trip not once in a lifetime just once not traveling more sooner we did a lot when the kids were younger  but um there are a lot of things we should've probably done we didn't do i wish i had gone to chicago <chica> we would always go to chicago on thanksgiving but i think we should've gone more than just on thanksgiving my parents come here at around christmas time but i think we should've uh done a lot more when it comes to that  yes that's that's that's why it's a regret because it could've been avoided there's things we could've done and we were spending our time working and more concerned about getting ahead than actually family and what's closest to us     i think that people <peop> most people oh yes very definitely  ooh  that's a good question ten or twenty years ago  i would've said um don't take things too seriously but don't be too relaxed over 'em either sometimes you can uh take things for granted never take anything for granted  nothing's promised  oh heaven forbid  <laughter> no i have not <laughter> no no  no  very very easy i really have no problem with that once in awhile if i uh am anxious about something or have things coming up due or projects due then i get kind of uh anxious a little bit  i don't like to be late uh i don't like to make mistakes so therefore i i do have some anxiety issues which will cause me to stay up all night to get things done just to make sure that i have everything right  tired  i don't get irritable i think i just uh lethargic maybe a little <litt> just a just a little bit  very good i was up late last night so i'm kinda tired now but i i usually have no problems sleeping  uh and i get a good night's sleep  mhm no i have not  um no not at all i just came back off a christmas break <laughter> so i'm should be very relaxed now ooh i have great kids  i have a son at u_s_c and i have a son at u_c_l_a  and my daughter just got married  so i'm i'm proud of my i'm really proud of my kids  they're they're going to have a good life  oh yes um i enjoyed it i still enjoy it  being a parent is forever <laughter> so  uh <sigh> let's see  taking care of someone else and getting started off to have a good life   i think that that's rewarding making sure everything is covered  that needs to be covered with you kids whether it's their eating their sleeping their clothes they dress make sure they're content make sure they have no problems at school or home or uh that that they're safe physically mentally spiritually everything hmm my best friend would say she has not changed since high school <laughter> uh level-headed but uh great sense of humor relaxed i don't take things too seriously ooh i love the holidays i love christmas i love everything about it i love preparing the house for it i love baking cooking especially baking i love experimenting with new recipes and so the last couple of weeks because the holiday season was just here i felt fantastic everything is is quiet i'm not at work i'm not stressed out in any way at all i have no projects due that i have to think about anyway  so uh christmas time holiday time  really enjoyed recently well christmas of course we went to las vegas um the twenty seventh of december that was fantastic <fantas> we only stayed for two days we had a really good time uh we saw a great show  we had some great food we drove there we don't usually drive i don't like to drive a lot but we drove there and just took our time so it was good it was nice  okay  goodbye thanks for listening how's that one okay,0

325,yes um i'm fine this is a little bit strange you know talking to a virtual human um i was born i was born in l_a i was raised out in the suburbs um i've lived all over los angeles i've lived in the valley long beach and now i'm in culver city um there's great food here the weather is great most of the time there's a lot of sunshine it doesn't get cold i don't have to shovel snow there are lots of opportunities a lot of diversity all different sorts of people uh i think that's really great  that is a much longer list i would like to get out of here um the the traffic i think that's number one i think everybody hates the traffic and everybody's so busy all the time it's really hard to to get together with anybody everybody's so devoted to their jobs and uh then we're sitting in traffic a lot too  i just graduated actually um i studied marine biology i was i went to school and i orginally studied um graphic design and i found that kind of unfulfilling so i took a trip for a while traveled around the world and started scuba diving and i realized that i really loved marine biology so that's how i got into it  everybody's been asking me that a lot lately since i just graduated i think i would like to <exhaling>  um i think maybe managing a um managing a research you know i'm not i'm not really sure i think i would like to something in tropical marine ecology maybe like managing a preserve um something like that it's a hard question to answer <laughter> i do um i like meeting new people and seeing different parts of the world well i traveled for eight months in central america um and i visited a lot of different countries i um i went scuba diving i think um i think intolerance injustice in the world those are probably the things that get me the most fired up vent to my boyfriend does that count <laughter> i'm pretty good it takes it takes a lot to really get me um fired up to the point where i i kinda blow my top the very few people that have seen me angry um to the point where i'm kind of yelling and screaming angry um i don't know i just don't get there i think that i'm a little bit afraid of losing my temper so i keep it under control  <laughter> it was yesterday actually i argued with my boyfriend um about uh getting getting a job i was talking about taking a job somewhere and he was being very supportive and i really wanted him to to say no don't go take that job for six months 'cause i would miss you and he was just being supportive so um we kind of argued about that <laughter> and it was ridiculous so we i ended up laughing and that was the end of the fight um meditate excercise go out in nature just um unplug get myself away from the computer away from technology away from people  i would say not really um i'm an only child and it's just me and my parents and we're very very dissimilar for example um i'm a pretty adventurous person and i like learning and my parents are uh couch potatoes they like to watch reality television so we don't have too much to talk about or things that we can really do um as far as shared activites so you know i love them and everything but there's not too much common ground yes i think i'm a very social introvert but i seem to find most social encounters to be draining where as my my boyfriend for example he um derives a lot of pleasure and energy from being around people for me it's always a little bit the opposite i have to recharge  i not sure i have a best friend but um i guess i'll say my boyfriend he's he's kinda my default best friend um he would probably say passionate intelligent um he always tells me that i'm really hard on myself which is true um dedicated loyal   i think i'm just proud of who i am xxx i don't know if that's the answer that most people give but i think that i'm i'm really proud of who i am i try really hard um i've done a lot of things in my life i'm a really good person i think it's it's kind of rare to find people that are kind and i consider myself  a kind person that that cares about others and wants to make the world a better place so i'm i'm proud of that <laughter> no i have not no yes i was probably about fifteen at the time so i think eight was is that seventeen years ago  yes um i was cutting and my one of my best friends called um called my parents and let them know and at that point they took me in for treatment i that wasn't the first time i had ever been to a therapist or a psychiatrist but um before it was more they thought i had a_d_h_d so um it was more <m> i think my parents really took me in rather than me seeking help i haven't for about three years uh i stopped because it felt like uh i was checking in with a parole officer i just wasn't enjoying the relationship i had but i still have the psychiatrist that i go to for med checks  <laughter> uh i do think it's useful if you have the right therapist i think if you don't have a good relationship with your therapist it can be incredibly harmful i have talked to people that have had bad experiences and and won't ever go back lately i've been a little bit down um i should say a little bit more down than usual because i graduated and my routine of go to school and do school things twenty four seven has come to an end and without the routine it's been a little bit  weird finding out what to do with my finding a way to be productive and knowing what to do with my time it's also been a little bit um depressing finding out that my intelligence and good grades in school doesn't translate to real world skills and there aren't that many jobs for marine biologists in california  almost impossible ever since i was a little kid i had a i had trouble falling asleep and um about four years ago it it became really really bad where i just couldn't sleep through the night i was getting about four hours of sleep  sometimes i would wake up every hour and i'd wake up in the morning just a complete wreck so for about four years i've been taking trazadone so i can sleep um have you ever seen fight club um you're a virtual human so you probably haven't seen that but it's it's pretty much like that i i'm just um a complete panicked anxious wreck i i lose my ability to deal with um i lose my ability to deal with things i'm much more likely to lose my temper um i can't regulate my moods i'm just really volatile probably a few months ago i think that i may have been on a trip gone away for a weekend and forgotten to take my medicine with me um or something like that and then i can't sleep and so that's what happens   uh <makes sound with mouth> really happy i mean um i don't know it's easy for me easier for me to keep track of when i feel really really bad really happy i guess i felt happy on new year's really happy on new year's eve which was um uh ten days ago um i was with my boyfriend and some friends and we took a trip out to palm spring and joshua tree and it was really nice to see them i don't get to see them very often um because i've been in school and i've been so busy so it was really nice reintroduction to uh real life i think that i'm i'm kind i'm considerate i'm tolerant i'm pretty open minded i'm aware of my faults um i just i just try to be nice to everybody and i'm very curious about um about the world and things that i don't know about i really like to learn  uh off the top of my head first thing that came comes to mind is diving the blue whole in belize it was really amazing um it was me and my friends we just you know jumped off the boat and you come up over the edge of this uh limestone sink hole and it's really really really blue and you just drop down to about a hundred and forty feet in something like two minutes we did it pretty quick not everybody could do it that quick and um as you go down you see all these stalagmites and stalactites and they're huge they're larger than human and 'cause it's this  cave system um and it's really murky and there's sharks swimming all around you so  that was that was pretty good <laughter>  i'm trying to remember that at the moment i haven't had much free time the last three and a half years being in school um <laughter> so uh i guess reading hiking um just being together with my friends doing um relatively low key things going to movies having dinner parties cooking playing with my cat not that i can really think of i'm sure i've made mistakes in my life but um you know i'm still here so can't be that bad hmm um i don't know hang in there um hold on to your clothes 'cause the nineties are coming back in fashion hmm um cloudy weather uh beautiful sunsets being in um being out in nature kind of being away from the hubub of the city getting a good grade <laughter> i think my boyfriend has he's just um especially the last year he's really inspired me he quit drinking he quit smoking he's  really inspired me he quit drinking he quit smoking he's made a lot of positive changes in his life and i know that those things aren't aren't hard or aren't easy i should say um to <t> so to see someone overcome that  uh really inspired me  okay,1

328,yes <laughter>  fine how are you uh watts california but now i live in west l_a  <laughter> yes i love uh the sunshine i love the palm trees i love that um you're thirty minutes away from everything it's a great city   the traffic it's terrible  i studied child development  yeah actually i uh teach children how to be safe in uh traffic situations  oh my dream job is to be a filmmaker that's what i wanna do i wanna die doing that job making movies  well when i was uh in high school i did a lot of drama theater productions and i just love everything about film so once i had the opportunity to actually make a film uh because i wasn't getting any work as an actor i just got hooked i just love making film <laughter>  last time i made a film just this last october made a short film  <laughter> it's about three people that connect together they're completely unrelated but they get to a retreat where they realize that their problems are bigger than what they imagined originally thanks <laughter>  really mad uh  <laughter> really mad i you know i guess what makes me really mad is when my daughter acts stupid at school when she does not do her work and uh when she doesn't pay attention and i have to get phone calls home and letters home and emergency parent conferences that's what makes me mad  yeah  <laughter> yeah yeah it sucks she's one of the smartest kids in her school  no it's it's it's very difficult because a lot of things in yourself that you find are negative go to them and it's like you're fighting against yourself trying to change yourself but you know that little person is you you know times a hundred and it's just difficult to deal with that but um other than that it it's okay but it's being a parent is never easy   <sigh>  the hardest thing about being a parent  i would say is trying to give that little person so much life experience so that they don't make mistakes or so that they don't get hurt and you wanna give it to them and you want them to just accept it right away but then they don't so it gets very uh  um annoying sometimes that you know what's coming and you give them the info and they don't wanna take it they wanna find their own way and to watch them get hurt it's it's sad and then they wanna come to you and you're like ugh i tried to tell you but you can't be mad at them because everybody learns their own way so    mm yeah i guess for a while when when you think about it uh when you watch them go through their struggles it's hard to watch but it's a necessary motion of life children have to learn the way they wanna learn 'cause once they get it they got it so however they get it you as a parent you're happy they got it  <sigh> all the love the children bestow upon you it's great they  yeah they love <lo> you know love you and all especially my daughter she always wants to give me hugs she always wants to talk to me she always wants to be around me uh she always tells me i'm doing a great job when i'm like <laughter> what does she know about a great job she's only seven but you know they have that unconditional love and you just can't help but feel like a good person for having the children tell you that you're a good person so i like that  hmm oh <laughter> my god they're ooh <sigh> they're you know it like albert einstein said it best that our technology has exceeded our humanity and there's so much technology out there kids are learning so fast it's almost like they're already little adults but they're missing the steps to being a child they miss going outside they miss learning about things naturally rather than just going to youtube or you know wherever facebook and and getting it so fast and they don't know what to do with all this information and they just have to fight through all that info and they the it's not organic anymore children growing up these days it's not organic it's sped up it's pushed and it's just so hard for them to figure out who they are in this world so that's what's wrong hmm me <laughter> just <sharp inhale> breathe in <sharp exhale> and breathe out or i'll just walk away from the situation  argued  i argued with my fiancee uh a couple months ago about gosh i forgot i i forgot i don't remember  it was petty yeah but it didn't last long 'cause she's like me she doesn't like to argue about stuff we like to take care of stuff as it happens and that's it hmm my fiancee <laughter> well um well i mean we met um when i was working at at a charter <ch> not a charter school but at a recreational center we met there and uh we talked we hit it off uh we didn't see each other for an entire year and then uh we reconnected and we went on a date and it was great ever since my family we're pretty close my brother lives in colorado my sister lives in oklahoma i have a dad that lives in a neighboring city where i am um as close as we can be with the distance and certain choices that my family have made over the years you know being far away and um but my immediate family like you know my fiancee and my daughter like we're close and it's great <laughter> i don't travel enough but i have traveled a couple of times uh within the last five years i just came back from new zealand so that was a great experience  yeah  i enjoy meeting new people that's the biggest thing about traveling i like seeing new things i like just immersing myself in different cultures and situations and i like just being away from it all that's that's good too well i went to new zealand uh not too long ago and i had <ha> stayed there for a week um i learned about celsius 'cause you know here we have fahrenheit and that was fun uh i learned how to play cricket   uh i learned how to get myself out of a capsized kayak and um i learned that they have a lot of lamb lamb is good i like lamb but they had a lot of lamb oh and their seafood <seaf> seafood i can't eat but they do have really great chocolate chocolate is <sigh> it was so good and ice cream was good too and uh the people were really really nice they it was a very special time for me to go there it was great and they accepted me i love that and yeah can't wait to go back  <laughter> yes it was some of my best qualities um energetic uh very personable uh intelligent i am easy to get along with i work pretty hard and i'm very slow to getting upset about things  no  no no mm it's fairly easy  <laughter> uh i guess i get pretty moody you know i could be a little little snappy at people when i don't sleep well when i have lack of sleep but once i get some sleep in me i'm okay mm fine  no no no changes no scrubbed_entry um you know he would say that i'm pretty funny um lax about a lot of things uh i enjoy life as much as i possibly can um good friend to have around and always ready and eager to help <laughter> just waking up in the morning <laughter> it's always a great thing uh i love ice cream that's always good i love laughing ugh if somebody's laughing especially my fiancee 'cause she has a great laugh then that puts me in a good mood hmm thank you  scrubbed_entry and that's what i wanna do i definitely wanna get into acting and really work it and get some really good roles so he's been a positive influence he stayed out of trouble um he's maintained a good working relationship with people and he's always positive and very super helpful and very encouraging      oh we went to junior high school and high school together so he's my best friend  yeah  <laughter> yes it is  wow there's so many uh  scrubbed_entry had uh these bag of m and m's and we had went to a play and there were two girls that were a couple of rows down that you know we didn't particularly care for but you know that's how kids are you just they don't know how to you know they say they don't like somebody but you know anyway but we got these m and m's and while the it was dark we start throwing m and m's and hitting 'em in the head with the m and m's and then we came to school like three days later uh we were summoned and there was a mock trial to get scrubbed_entry so we were able to get ourselves off on like the entire group had found us not guilty of the crime and but then we got in trouble anyway because our teacher just wouldn't allow us to not get in trouble so we had to clean up the yard for like two days  oh man you name it uh i love scuba diving i've only done it twice but i love it wanna get back into it like traveling uh i love exercising i actually like working out now uh i used to think it was a chore but now i'm really really getting into it that i love watching movies you put me in front of a good movie and i'm a happy camper so that's about it hanging out with family  anything i regret hmm <deep breath> you know what i think i <laughter> i probably regret not going up to will smith when i had the chance  yeah uh will smith was coming up the street and i saw him and i got so nervous i jumped in the bushes and i didn't meet him uh my boss at the time thought it was really funny but i just i wasn't ready to meet him yet so but i think i regret meeting him   advice i would give myself ten or twenty years ago i would probably say that when my gut told me to do something i should've just went on ahead and did it rather than sit and analyze it you know days weeks months later if i feel it in my gut i should go for it so go with my gut more  really happy  hmm really happy i i had a film festival that i was putting together and things were so intense we things were going wrong but then things were going right but then once the people came and packed the house i was really happy that we had a packed house at this uh film festival so this was about a month ago  yeah  <sigh> let's see i think right now at this point i'm most proud of putting a short film together with a minimal budget but it has amazing actors it has a great storyline and i didn't think it could be done but it's done or close to being done and i'm i'm proud of that i was able to get it done i think i could walk away happy knowing that i gave it a really good shot and i think this movie is probably going to take me and the rest of my film crew buddies to higher heights oh really  alright well what was your name again  ah ellie  goodbye ,0
329,yes pretty well from new york uh to go to college well to san diego to go to college and then later to l_a aerospace engineering um it was i was really good at math and science and i had a interest in airplanes no i'm a life coach uh to be a life coach and help people um i really really like uh how it feels to help other people and see them grow and know that i made a contribution to their life  um i like the weather it's it's great 'cause i really like to do outdoor things and i like uh doing things by the ocean traffic <laughter> and how crowded it is yeah um i like i live with my girlfriend and so i like it  uh we met on e harmony uh really close um my meditation teacher um yeah i i used to be very shy and self conscious and had a lot of anxiety and um i'd worry a lot about the future and uh i took classes in meditation and yoga classes and uh it really helped me to be more confident and more relaxed and just enjoy life a lot more  uh meditate and do yoga um let's see really mad um  i guess i don't know about mad i don't get mad that often but frustrated uh i would say like being stuck in traffic or um people that do mean things to other people for no real reason  um i usually if it's i usually talk to somebody about it if i can or if i can't then i'll usually do meditation or yoga and try and just let it go  uh pretty good at controlling my temper uh with my girlfriend and it was about um she was driving on the freeway and uh i suggested that she get over 'cause there was some road workers on the side and she like refused to do that and stayed in the the right lane so we argued a bit about that  uh it felt like she wasn't listening to me and almost like she was purposely not doing what i suggested to be defiant   um no um rollerblade kayak uh sing i sing in a choir  um a trip i took to india and nepal for six weeks yeah as much as i can <laughter> uh i really i love to explore i've i've loved to explore ever since i was a little kid and so i love you know seeing new things and discovering things about new cultures and i love backpacking in the wilderness and you know exploring nature  cool um well i went on a a trip to india and nepal it's my first time ever there um first week and a half i was with a big group of people and did a meditation and yoga retreat and went white water rafting on the ganga river and then um i went off on my own for the rest of the trip and went backpacking in nepal uh with a guide there and uh it was just really beautiful um in the anapurna area and then i went to uh back into india and explored um the area up near tibet and then uh went to uh rajasthan and to uh tiger park in madhya pradesh and was like really close to tigers um there i uh was contacted by a friend of mine and told that they were going on this this trip and i'd always wanted to go to india so i decided to do it  yeah it was it was really fun um caring and uh enthusatic for life no no no um pretty easy uh i don't sleep as well as i did when i was younger but for the most part i i sleep well once in a while i'll wake up you know at like four in the morning or five in the morning when i want to sleep 'till seven and not be able to get back to sleep but um in general it's pretty good uh i feel tired and not as motivated as usual and then sometimes wanna take a nap you know in the afternoon um no  um ten or twenty years ago um i guess to i i wish i would have invested money or bought like a house or something when i was younger um that would probably be the advice i would give myself   um i am empathetic with other people um positive and kind of have a positive outlook on life um very determined when i decide to do something uh i'll figure out how to do it even if it's challenging um i'm very creative in figuring out creative ways to do things i guess probably the strongest thing is that i'm pretty balanced i'm very organized but i'm also pretty creative so um pretty balanced that way  um pretty close uh much closer than i was when i was younger um and although i'd say i'm probably closer to friends and people that are in a spiritual community with me than i'm able to get to my family  uh being outdoors in nature and exercising and also singing um the fact that i've gone with followed my heart and did what i wanted to do versus gong with what i think i should do um i guess yesterday i was i spent the day by the beach and just uh bicycled and went skating and um visited some old friends there um felt very relaxed and uh invigurated and um uh i also felt like i miss living by the beach because i used to live really close to the beach  so i guess i was a little bit sad that i didn't live there anymore but uh really happy to be there goodbye,0
330,<laughter> yes i'm okay with this very good l_a it's sunny and uh it's near the ocean <sigh> uh the traffic can make it difficult to drive around between different places and there's a lack of uh uh open uh spaces if you're not near a beach uh no um i uh i haven't planned on haven't finalized any travel plans listen to music yeah um uh well i tend to excel at things that  have to do with um uh spending time alone versus things that have to do with uh spending time outside with uh lots of people i'm reasonable mm maybe maybe yesterday i was trying to figure out how to stuff <stu> pack something into the car i'm very good at it <deep breath> i breathe in and out <sigh> like that <sigh> uh like jogging walking bicycling reading <sigh> listening to music uh math engineering computers uh a little bit yeah um i'm a student i'm going back to school for uh biological sciences um <sigh> started doing some reading on um some textbooks dream job um <sigh>  medical doctor uh it's i guess it depends on the type of medicine you practice <laughter> uh i have a mentor yeah i have a mentor who has a lot of positive um thoughts and um suggestions i uh through a professional so i met someone through a class and then they worked with them professionally so it's i guess you could say through an academic or professional channel <sigh> hmm mm <sigh> uh let's see one of my most memorable i can't think of one at the moment no no i don't think so no <sigh> takes me a little while to fall asleep but once i'm asleep it's it's reasonably okay uh i think i'm a little forgetful and nervous no sometimes mm what do you wanna know mm <sigh> well um i think sometimes i do think about  challenges ahead of me and uh that can be a little daunting and i i feel down it is very hard go for a walk read a book listen to some music um <sigh> i don't i mean i'm sure they are i'm not specifically sure what triggers anything uh maybe feeling overwhelmed or uh not feeling particularly tied to some task i don't go to a therapist um reasonably smart inquisitive <inqui> inquisitive and curious mm i guess through classes uh <sigh> somewhat mm patience and curiosity uh <sigh> enjoyed hmm mm think i went on a walk at night uh a day ago no can you repeat that can you rephrase that uh i think they're lucky very lucky got everything in front of 'em yeah uh <sigh> most proud of <deep breath> <sigh> maybe academic achievements uh i guess just the time i've spent studying math and science um hmm mm mm i'm not sure,1
331,yes  okay  connecticut um  to be an actor <laughter>  well i moved to san francisco in ninety four and then i moved to atlanta in ninety six and then i moved out here to be an actor and i became a realtor instead  um to be on a t_v show an actor  it's pretty hard to get discovered and uh  you have to be lucky and you have to know the right people and you have to be talented   <laughter> yeah  not really no i don't travel that much i used to move um every couple years to a different city and then i've been here for a while so i don't travel much the weather um there's always something to do and um that's pretty much it <laughter>  um the people here tend to be a little more rude and um it's just always a fast pace  well when i moved here i was twenty five so it was a lot more fun because when you're young in the city you can have a lot of fun    and then i got into the real estate and did really well for a while and then the market crashed and so now i'm old and i'm not making any money so times are tough  no no i'm much <mu> much of more <m> more of an extrovert  um when i don't get what i want <laughter> and um  rude people  and um  just inconsiderate people  i'm pretty good um at controlling my temper when i'm not uh like if i if i drink alcohol it'll make my temper go worse but uh <ss noise> when i don't drink i'm pretty good at controlling my temper   uh the last time i argued with somebody was  somebody that owed me money  uh i live uh in west hollywood  no no no i live alone i have a dog it's good i mean i don't like my neighbors i hate my neighbors but the ones upstairs just moved out so that's good news hopefully the ones that move in are not that noisy and the ones below i just can't stand because they argue with me   huh why because they 'cause my hardwood floors they say that eh i've been there for ten years and they still argue about the noise of me walking on my hardwood floors  yeah  what was the question  my mother has been a very positive influence she's always kept me on track she lived with me for the last ten years until she recently moved to rhode island to live with my brother very close to my mother um not so close with my brother mm we're close but we're not like close close um so i mean we love each other we just don't really understand each other all the time  outgoing um life of the party  ambitious um  and sometimes cut-throat  um <psh psh> what am i most proud of  being always able to get through the things i need to get through to get to where i wanna be i'm generous i'm loyal uh i'm friendly i'm accommodating and um  that's about it  no yes  uh about four years ago  um i well i had <ha> i was beaten up and i had uh identity theft and uh you know i was just afraid to go out so i needed to get over that so after spending one year in in my home without leaving um and just depressed all the time i i said i have to get out and start talking to people and so i did    thank you  um okay i'm panicky about the job situation  um you know 'cause my bills are pretty high and i don't really have a steady income right now  so uh that's what's worrying me the most is my uh financial situation  yeah  um  yeah i mean  well basically it's like um i just recently quit drinking all together so i don't drink anymore so i'm noticing  yeah i mean it's good 'cause of number one i don't have the money and number two i don't like the way i act when i drink   um so so that's a positive thing but well the when i was drinking it helped me just forget and numb myself now i have to feel through the feelings which is pretty good 'cause i can talk my way through them so i guess i'm evolving  uh yeah a long time ago um you know i've taken many medications here and there and um they really some of 'em would numb me some of them would  make me feel hyper so i've recently decided to <t> in the last six months three to six months just to not take anything so i don't take anything i barely even take an aspirin  just to get my body to a to get my body to a normal state   um not really  always worrying just a lot of worrying always worrying worrying worrying about everything oh what happens if i get in car accident what happens if i can't pay my mortgage what happens if i eh eh just so many things i worry about and that's what was making me depressed i do at some point i've had some good therapists and i've had some bad therapists  um i tend to like the ones that talk back to me and kinda give me some guidance as opposed to the ones that just listen   and then they just say okay your time's up so and just prescribe me medication so i think i'd be better with a psychiatrist <psychia> psychologist as opposed to a psychiatrist um well i'm not going to therapy now but  the therapy that i had before um  was more like people trying to uh just come in and check in and give me medication um i have had other therapy where i was back and forth like okay well this is what i think about this and you think about this and that kind of therapy is better  um i just i wasn't getting the right therapists recently so um and i knew the the root of my problem was the drinking 'cause it's a depressant so  mm you know stopping the drinking is definitely made me have a much clearer mind and just to work through things myself you know  um  i can't really think of anything right now  um  it's been a long time i can't really think about a time when i felt really happy  thank you <sniffle> um  okay when i was a kid um  i had a a little dog and this big dog came and and attacked it and killed it  so then a little while later my father  came and he says to my brother and me we were kids go to the car there's two packages in the car so go get them  so i was like yeah yeah yeah yeah 'cause i never listened to my parents so i was just like a spoiled brat but finally he said go to the car what's that   oh okay he said go to the car and get this out of the car so i finally went and when i opened the door there was a new dog and a bag of dog food so that's one of my memorable esperiences   yeah 'cause i'm an animal lover so  um just the way that i've treated people before when i was hurting i was really mean or rude to people when i felt like you know i was hurting i had to hurt everybody around me so um but when <wh> ever since i stopped the drinking i don't do that anymore so  so i think the problem is is the drinking and so now that i've let that go uh 'cause i was doing it for the wrong reasons you know i was doing it to not not feel i wasn't doing it to be sociable  get in a career that is really stable  like uh eh you know like a a doctor or a nurse or an attorney something that you know or in advertising i should've gone into that a sales position is it could be very well and very good or very bad so you always have to be on it in sales you can make a ton of money in sales but when you make your money save your money don't go spend it on extravagant things  um when i have a job when i when i'm able to work  uh when i'm helping other people  uh when other people around me are happy and laughing when i can make people laugh that that puts me in a good mood  okay thank you  you're welcome thank you  bye ,0
332,yes  fine just tired  california  from hollywood  uh  not too much <laughter> there's not too many things i like about it  uh the people um it's not clean  too much crime too many drugs  uh makeup and hair  it is <laughter> a little bit  uh  not too much i just survive  <laughter>  very difficult  it's okay  uh i'm getting a little old to be thinking of a career but  i just want probably to get married and have a little security that's all just be a wife again <laughter> <sigh> uh a little bit close but everybody's pretty much passed away  <laughter>  um i play farmville on facebook  yeah  i'm good i don't really have a temper  uh it was my ex-husband about money <laughter>  <sigh>  people lying cheating conniving drug addicts you know just ugly people people that are  hideous in the inside you know  uh  jesus christ that's about it  my mother when she was alive well she still is a positive influence but  nobody really but  jesus <laughter>  uh  memorable experiences  i don't know i can't really think of one right now <laughter>  uh  gosh  memorable experiences  <sigh> oh i guess like maybe modeling that was pretty cool yeah  yeah  i was just kind of  um surreal like to see yourself in magazines and pictures and stuff you know <sharp inhale> i didn't understand how it could have been me but then my photographer told me he was like well someone has to do it it might as well be you so oh well <laughter> and it's true <laughter> so that was cool i don't just kinda fell into it by accident   i've always i'm sorry <so> yeah yeah  i wish i did it i took it further but um  i couldn't  really happy <laughter>  i don't remember  i really don't  uh i don't really have a best friend <laughter> but i'm sure  they would <wou> anybody would describe me as outgoing  yeah  no yes uh it was uh nineteen eighty four  yeah  i couldn't deal with it  so i had to see a psychiatrist  um  horrified um couldn't sleep  um panicked  um  major anxiety  yeah  yeah <laughter> yes  yes i do  it could be if you see the right doctor if you see <s> if yeah  um it gives you the opportunity to talk to somebody and hopefully they can give you answers most of 'em don't they try to find the answers inside of you and get it out of you but it's just good to be able to talk to somebody that's kinda biased neutral  really depressed <laughter> extremely depressed  yeah  poverty <laughter>  yeah   uh huh yeah i'm a lot more tired i sleep longer and  i um  i just don't have the drive motivation that i did before   just try to be strong just have to get through it you know yes  there are  not really <laughter> i'm an open book  yeah  um  <sigh> i'm a well i would say a perfectionist but that's not really a good quality 'cause it can get dangerous um  i'm just artistic i'm good at a lot of things i'm really good at a lot of things but xxx well i'm good at i'm a good hairdresser and makeup artist um uh i crochet and knit really well make jewelry um not good with computers or phones though electronics  yeah  um i keep a perfect house or well when i'm not depressed like this i was a perfect wife the perfect wife  so yeah  but not anymore 'cause i'm divorced now  but it wasn't me  it was him  so he was on drugs <laughter> so he chose eh the drugs were <w> were too much problems  yeah it does  it's really hard because it's like the drugs are his mistress mhm how how do i what  who <wh> who oh  yes  no but um  well i don't really consider myself an introvert  um yeah  i have a lot of regrets but there really wasn't anything i could do about it so there's really no point in regretting it 'cause you do what you do and you make a decision and then  it's already done so why regret it why bother you know  mhm make sure that when you marry a man that you ask him if he does drugs or alcohol <laughter>  that's one for sure that was the only question i didn't answer <answe> ask i  i didn't know there's a lot of things  a lot of stuff you know uh <laughter> i don't know  just the things that i can do  that my talents that's it  uh  um  well if i can have my starbucks  and my orange gina i drink orange gina everyday and i smoke cigarettes unfortunately but it's always good to have those because you know i'm addicted to them  and then if i can eat something really  good and healthy at nighttime and  in fact i well basically if i have something to do if i have a goal uh somewhere to go something to do like today even  puts me in a good mood yeah otherwise i'd be afraid that i'd stay home and just lay in bed or farm all day i could farm for eight hours on farmville   yeah  you're welcome nice to meet you <laughter> ,1
333,yes very well  new york  just turn the volume up a little bit  <laughter> uh for a change yeah it's good  i wanted <wa> i wanted to i wanted to see what los angeles was about  um probably took a year or two  uh you know being away from my family being away from what i was used to in new york the neighborhoods the people and just getting acclimated to a whole new lifestyle here uh the weather  you can't beat the weather it's generally always nice it's not too hot it's not too cold uh it's creative i do like uh you know movies  uh like the beach  the traffic it's a lot of traffic uh  some of the sometimes i think people are a little bit colder here than and more distant and unfriendly than other places  i was a history major  no uh i do uh demonstrations in really <rea> uh high-end supermarkets uh to be a screenwriter  that's one of the reasons why i came to los angeles  um it's hard 'cause i don't always maintain uh focus and motivation i let other things distract me <laughter>  uh i was uh i've always been interested in films ever since i was a child and i was just always you know was writing and had an active imagination   uh i've in the last probably almost ten years i've traveled more than i had in the past <pa> well i've always traveled even as a kid my parents would travel around so yes seeing new places and seeing uh people that are different than i am seeing how they live  and taking in the sights  uh i went to kenya that was probably one of the best trips i ever went on um on the safari and   just going out in a jeep and seeing <laughter> wild animals in their own natural habitat was pretty incredible   oh yeah that's one the great experiences of my life and i also got to uh  a a place in egypt uh at the end of that trip um called uh  sharm el sheikh which is right on the water and it has some of the best scuba diving in the world which is hard to believe that egypt would but it was just amazing i went <we> i didn't go scuba diving i went uh snorkeling  what do i do to relax uh i i do i like to listen to music i like to uh helping watching movies helps me relax 'cause it takes me out of you know whatever might be on my mind i do meditate every day um i like to take walks in nature that's always calming especially down by the uh the ocean  uh what i it depends <laughter> sometimes i get angry and lose my temper uh a lot of times uh  i'll do like a form of self-hypnosis and calm myself which is something i've recently learned how to do  which is very helpful  and also since i meditate it doesn't i don't get annoyed at things as easily as i did in the past some things that makes me really mad  i guess uh think of injustice  in the world or done to people when uh it doesn't really need to be that way that we could all get along  um  and and make the world better <laughter> uh last night i went to a movie screening  of a independent film and i didn't think it was done very well it's not so much that we had a fun argument  about uh about the movie  so that was like you know that just happened yesterday so that was that's on my mind  <laughter> is there anything i regret yeah there's there are have been opportunities in my life that i wished i had uh taken them and pursued them  uh certain jobs you know when i first got to los angeles i had an opportunity to uh  become a grip and uh and i i probably should've pursued that  how did i decide it to do that i don't really understand the questions take advantage of every opportunity that came my way  to always <alway> i think saying yes  uh to any opportunity is is very important and no matter   how you feel you know you have to be confident that you'll be able to achieve what you wanna do  no no no but i've been depressed in my life  uh for the most part i've i've been feeling good sometimes uh i feel a little blue uh i think you know sometimes if i if i allow <allo> allow a regret to come into my mind that can bring me down but i can you know usually get out if it pretty quickly  uh sometimes financial concerns sometimes uh  an an opportunity um how do i explain it eh there  sometimes <so> sometimes <someti> eh financial is one way i that i if i had made another decision i might have more money or my life would be different  um  not really i mean i i feel  pretty much the same what got me to seek help for <laughter> let's come back to that  um i've well okay well it generally talking to someone has helped when i did do that  uh pretty easy i don't have a problem sleeping  uh  usually i'm grumpy <laughter> so if i don't sleep well uh you know i feel tired and irritable   uh  how would my best friend describe me that's a good question um friendly <f> well i'm friendly <f> i'm definitely friendly and outgoing uh little bit secretive um i would probably that i should be they'd like to see me more accomplished and uh and uh attaining my goals and happier <ha> maybe a little happier   i think um  it it it's tough it depends sometimes i'm very introverted 'cause i do like to write so that takes it means that i have to spend time alone and then when i come out of that uh i'm extroverted so i don't really see myself with as one hard way or the other it all depends on my on the situation and my mood  my best qualities um i think i'm caring i think i'm intelligent  uh i think i'm funny i'm outgoing um i have a likeable personality  you know people have said that  um i'm engaging but not uh oppressive or overly engaging there's a sort of a cool detachment  um and creative intuitive  <laughter> yes <laughter>  last time i felt really happy  i don't know i woke up this morning i was pretty happy  i had breakfast i was happy  sun was shining  <laughter>  um  i think that like i said going to kenya  was a memorable experience i do remember <remem> scuba uh snorkeling was a really great experience <ex> experience i just remembered you know seeing all the colors in the ocean  you know and feeling the sun powerful sun on my back  um almost beyond you know because <beca> almost beyond like   human in a way just more in touch with like everything the universe yeah it would be nice to feel that way every moment of the day but  what am i most proud of in my life  i think i've uh helped <pft> people  uh and sometimes when they were in crisis um you know i've written some screenplays <scr> screenplays um  i've had some good relationships  um good relationships just you know being connected with someone else you know  spending time with them and connecting  on emotional and  <laughter> physical and  mental levels  um what it could be a song that i hear on the radio uh it could be uh lot of times looking forward to something you know if i'm gonna go to a movie go bowling hang out with people um you know looking at work and and going to work and feeling productive can put me in it puts me in a good mood you're welcome bye bye,0
335,yes i'm okay  uh i'm from here originally los angeles  mhm um i like the weather  and my family's here which is why i'm here i moved away for a while uh i like that there's a lot of culture <cult> even though everyone says there's not culture in l_a there is a lot of culture there's theater and film and lots of museums and things like that all different kinds of people i like the diversity    mhm um  well i don't like that i had to move back kind of against my will <laughter> so starting a new career uh starting over in my career it so that's not really something uh well i moved back 'cause my dad was sick  so thank you  thank you so that's why i'm here but it also means i live with my dad and my brother who are like hoarders and ridiculous so  uh acting theater it was mhm yeah  yeah i am   i'm an actor i uh right now i'm doing a a theater show and auditioning and taking some classes and  that sort of thing  um well my parents are both artsy people and i grew up around it and for a long time i was singing and then uh i was went to study musical theater and somewhere along the lines i realized that acting was more my bag than singing i suppose but i still do both  mhm no i don't  uh i don't usually have trouble talking to people uh i'm pretty friendly i can get along with most people people usually tell me their secrets within five minutes of meeting me which i feel is a mark of an extrovert <laughter>    <laughter> um  i take a bath or read a book uh go out with my friends go to the theater uh eh sometimes my work is very relaxing so sometimes just like singing a song or any of that going for a walk  mhm yoga things that make me mad um  injustice <laughter> i can be very righteously indignant i suppose um  people who don't see those things and people who've who have a like entitlement i think entitlement and sense of privilege that can make me mad  yeah  uh  it depends i usually <usual> a lot of times it's i argue my case <laughter> i guess <laughter> um or i i call my best friend usually and complain talk to her about it  pretty good pretty good i don't have too much of a temper  um like a real argument or like a debate  <laughter> um if was a real argument it probably would be my ex-boyfriend and we just argued about why we broke up stupid things like that  eh i think i was kind of over it by then but  it was at times  <laughter>  um  the last time i felt really happy  was like really happy probably hanging out hanging out with friends the other night i had a good time uh scrubbed_entry it is it's nice it's nice my best friend would describe me as an open book she often makes fun of me for like just telling everyone everything um she would describe me as   uh compassionate and uh having a a strong sense of who i am  i think yeah she also she would describe me as not having like a good sense of social norms sometimes probably that's something that she  makes fun of me for um because i do just like tell everyone everything and don't realize that i have like holes in my clothes and things like that but nothing nothing bad we have a very good relationship hmm yeah yeah it has <laughter> not terrible trouble but but yeah it's gotten me in trouble before sure  no i haven't  no but i think i had it  but i never went to a doctor  um 'cause i had a i had a traumatic situation uh where somebody injured me and i i feel <fe> when i looked up p_t_s_d later i realized <reali> i felt like i had all of the symptoms of like going back into situations like that i would get panicky and um it was very     uh i held on to it for a really really long time i think um i think that i did have it but i just i don't know 'cause i never i never saw anyone about it   um  sometimes yeah uh certain physical things with that part of my body can be a trigger or um it happened in a in an acting class so sometimes certain teachers if they criticize in a certain way i start to i start to panic even if they're totally right and i know they're right and like it's something that someone else could tell me and i'd be fine with it eh sometimes it'll make me a little upset or panicky yeah  no well i mean my dad is sick so not great  but um but considering not terrible  um i've been having bad dreams  uh  uh just like stress dreams i think having to do with my dad   um  like getting kidnapped or my teeth falling out things that if you looked them up always say like there's something out of your control which is like exactly what it is so      it's not the best but it's just dreams at least so   which way  okay  easy very easy  i am tired and maybe somewhat irritable goofy i get really goofy yeah  um i am fairly non-judgmental  of other people i i i stay open-minded uh i can make most people laugh i'm funny uh creative  um i yeah those are some of the best ones i'd say   yeah  i love meeting new people and seeing new things and learning uh and just getting out of the routine i like staying in hotels uh i like most things about traveling i even i even like flying i like all of it well i just finished a tour a couple months ago um going up and down the east coast and then across the u_s and uh performing for kids all over   yeah and then we ended here in l_a  yeah yeah it was great it was a good time  yeah um  lemmi think we  we went to  the hot springs the naturally occuring hot springs in colorado and that was really nice that was a nice way to unwind yeah  a lot of people i i would say um i mean my dad comes to mind certainly uh my godmother is a huge positive influence in my life as well   uh my best friend my best friend from high school i think i uh some <so> a few of my best friends from high school um and college that i've kinda grown up with and become who i am with them yeah  mhm uh small things sure  yeah uh i regret  the way that i dealt with a friendship that was ending once uh i regret  committing to certain people that i've dated  uh  but nothing huge i i tend to go well i won't do that again but i don't spend a lot of time like being upset about things i've done in the past  hmm stand up for yourself  um  <laughter> don't date felons <laughter> uh i think that i i don't have any trouble standing up for things that i believe in but sometimes i have trouble standing up for myself i think i i really internalize the idea of like you know women being too needy or uh or um i don't know those kinds of things and then xxx and so as as an adolescent and growing up i felt like well you then you just shouldn't need anything or you're needy and it took me a while to be able to like voice what i want what i needed from other people and be okay with that and it's still something i work on  <laughter> i'm glad you think so  um  <sigh> that's a good question uh  my friends and family  and uh  i my talents i would say  yeah  yeah my ability to take situations and  take bad situations and continue and uh make the best of everything  alright  <laughter> thank you  goodbye goodbye <laughter> ,1
336,hello sure good a little tired indianapolis indiana  uh i'm a singer i like singing  um diversity my girlfriend's uh from taiwan so it's dealing with different cultures  the traffic the uh crazy people it's um  seems hard to get anything really accomplished <laughter> it took me about six months just to figure out the directions twenty eight years ago a long time haven't been there in about eight or ten years well uh i don't like my brothers so i don't want to hang around them i started my girlfriend uh we did about uh just went back got back from orlando and uh she likes to travel so meeting new people seeing new places uh helps me to get out of l_a and get a different perspective uh i just did the avatar seminar which is like a raise your consciousness and um cleaned out the crap in your head  <laughter> um yeah i feel better uh been having a lot of psychic attack and it's uh i'm psychic so it's very hard to deal with it  <laughter> um well um there's more to life than what you see so um a lot of things are in other dimensions and other places so have to deal with not only the emotions but people uh direct energy at you um well have to do a lot of clearing and grounding and stay true to yourself i am both well i'm introverted because i like to spend time by myself and i'm extroverted 'cause i like to meet new people uh used to be totally an introvert  watch movies watch t_v read uh do crosswords i'm a singer sing write music i'm writing a novel um it's sort of like the matrix um well i wrote the first twenty pages pretty quick so um uh now i'm expanding it i get inspiration uh it was actually a dream and then i wrote down the dream and now it's becoming uh i could probably turn it into a movie <laughter> yeah uh when people don't respect me that's the number one no i just that my brothers they don't respect me they don't really um you know i want to love my family and but i don't want to hang around my brothers so it's a conflict exactly pretty good i only get mad about once a year um my girlfriend about two or three months ago she was wanting me to do something and i said no <yawn> and i don't know yeah she's my girlfriend i know her for about a year now pretty close um one time i was singing and scrubbed_entry and i was singing to an audience and that was great um well i'm looking into ways to expand my consciousness so that i can have more money and more abundance in my life so i can uh have my own house and uh live in my own creative space  <sniffle> uh singing i'm a singer so let's see like unforgettable so uh that's what i like to do no no no oh that's the hard part i uh i don't  i don't know maybe it's because when i was uh a kid my brothers beat me up and i don't feel totally rested in myself or in my life so uh i feel like uh <sniffle> i don't feel totally safe yeah um a little irritable but i have been sleeping better since i met my girlfriend so it's not totally bad my what behavior what i don't know um well i feel more positive i did the seminar and uh so that let me get rid of some crap in my brain <sniffle> and be more positive about life um well did a lot of exercises to uh reduce my stress and lot of my stress comes from uh judging myself and other people  yeah you could say that <laughter> uh well <sniffle> mm mm i don't know it's hard <yawn> hard to deal with sometimes i mean sometimes a lot much too critical for my own good uh <sniffle>  well watching t_v gets up but <yawn> uh lately i just been feeling like i need to um have less judgement and more fun  uh well i did that seminar um it was about a week ago i think  uh well i went to that seminar i got there i was able to take off work and <yawn> <sniffle> be in a different environment 'cause my job is stressful and <sniffle> my life is stressful so uh <sniffle> i was able to take a break which is great uh i'd say i'm outgoing fun smart uh but i mean in l_a people in l_a they don't want to most of them don't want to spend time with you i don't know if that's because of me or l_a <laughter> uh that i spend a lot of my time worrying and criticizing myself instead of moving forward avoid it yeah watching t_v or going to see movies or <sniffle> trying not to think of it but it doesn't solve the problem uh well a little bit i haven't paid my bills a lot i still owe money <sniffle> so um it's kind of a self-defeating prophecy <proph> prophecy  uh stop criticizing and start creating your future now instead of waiting for it to happen  uh my girlfriend's been really helpful <yawn> well she's funny and <sniffle> she loves me and cares about <abo> about me and  uh <laughter> yeah um singer and i'm intelligent and creative and multi-dimensional and uh i'm a good listener  uh well i've written about four or five books i uh my voice i think would be number one 'cause when i started i didn't have much of a singing voice but now i do okay bye bye,0

times um when i'm alone i am um extremely <sigh> i guess i would say um inter minded like i um have a lot of thoughts and i keep them to myself <clears throat>  so if i'm in that mode then i don't really um interact with people but i can also interact with people if i change modes um i just started doing yoga a couple of weeks ago and last week on thursday no on tuesday um  usually i just try to um remain quiet and listen to the situation if it's a person or if it's a situation <clears throat> that i'm dealing with myself that's annoying i try to um think of alternate ways that would make the situation better  um come up with alternate plans so i won't get annoyed um pretty good um mm i may have had an argument a few weeks ago um just about timeliness like meeting on time and showing up on time and it was actually last um monday yeah mhm no um to just be cautious of people's intentions and to listen really well 'cause people usually tell you what their intentions are without even um realizing <re> realizing it  um a good listener patient um fun loving generous um depressed sometimes um  but generally a good person no i have not yes um within a year and a half ago um i just knew that i often thought about situations that um happened in the past and kinda blamed the situation for my future and um um certain settings um if i  um see certain types of individuals in certain settings it just reminds me of when i was younger when things happened and changed my future plans so i um try to i used to just try to avoid those types of situations and certain types of people at that time but now i feel like i um just handle things better as far as um being in the similar settings with similar people i just i um handle those things better i do um i like to believe that it does i don't worry as much um it's just allowed me to know that actually speaking about the issues um relieves me of the tension of um holding them inside so that's how it's helped me at first it was difficult just being open with my internal emotions but now it um it actually is good because i know that when things are occurring  um if i'm able to um communicate about them with a certain individual it um relieves me of the stress of of uh trying to figure out everything alone and often times um by speaking about the issues it um allows me to come up with an alternative plan that may be be better just because i'm hearing myself speak of the issue  um i was diagnosed with depression and um my doctor felt that i should probably see the therapist um i am it depends um if i'm really busy during the week and have a lot of things to do i often try to plan things and if i'm planning things it affects my sleep i might wake up in the middle of the night so sometimes it's easy and sometimes it isn't irritable um very <v> just very irritable um i was feeling anxious but now i'm calmer um today i don't but i have in the past week um because i was in the midst of um searching for a a stable <s> a stable place to live and um it was just taking so long to find a stable place to live so i was becoming anxious  thank you yes um  maybe in october um well my mother first came she came to visit me in october and when she first got here we had a good time for the first couple days um so i was happy to see her i hadn't seen her in over a year mhm um i'm proud that i'm able to um  adjust to different situations um the older i've gotten the more adaptable i am to <t> in different environments in different situations and um i've learned how to be more resourceful so i'm proud of that um i'm sorry oh my dad and uh my sister she's positive 'cause she's finished her master's degree um my mom sometime um my best friend is very positive 'cause she just started her new business two years ago and she's very enthusiastic about it so that's an inspiration  um when someone lies consistently  um i listen very very well um sometimes i um give good advice i'm a good friend um i normally do the things that i say i'm going to do so i'm dependable um i communicate well  and i um enjoy people's company most of the time especially if they're in good moods um being around positive people music um puts me in a good mood um comedy shows put me in a good mood um good food puts me in a good mood  um when i graduated from high school it was a really um i will never forget it it was a wonderful day very confident accomplished and i was um extremely optimistic and hopeful for the future  you're welcome bye,1

341,sure i'm doing fine just a little tired california yes um the weather <laughter> not last week but yeah the weather <laughter> fear of earthquakes psychology i am i go to harbor college i am um wish i would've went sooner but better late than never probably i'm not sure i haven't really thought about it i wanna work in the field of psychology but i'm not sure if i wanna work with children or adults so i haven't really decided  no <laughter> i don't know i just don't maybe once a year um june actually i went to uh orlando florida sometimes yeah not as i'm sorry um watch t_v read a book talk on the phone mhm mad mm <sigh> my mom gets in my business <laughter> other than that um i guess just frustrations with my son no <laughter> um the hardest thing is um raising a child with a disability not knowing how you can help him it is it's very hard i don't sugarcoat it at all just having my children they're a blessing i love 'em <laughter> with all the good and the bad it's a part of me and i just love the fact that i'm helping mold them into  good human beings <laughter> we're really close i mean my family's small we live within blocks of each other but yeah we're close  good or bad <laughter> most memorable just giving birth for the first time it was just amazing my son is nine now so i still remember it like it was yesterday <laughter> like i was being born again myself i don't know how to explain it it just very emotional <laughter> i don't know <laughter> i guess i have a lot of regrets but none that i really wanna mention i guess <laughter> stay in school <laughter> don't get emotionally involved and um let people deter you from your goals <laughter> oh yeah definitely did you wanna move on i'm okay i mean i'm pretty easygoing  for the most part i don't really have a temper per se things frustrate me more than they anger me xxx oh that's easy <laughter> with my mother she's like um i guess the argument stemmed from me wanting to socialize <laughter> she feels that i'm married with children so i should stay at home like ninety nine percent of the time and i wanted to go out and socialize with some ex co-workers and she basically kinda put me down for it as if i don't spend enough time with my children <laughter>  it does and i love my mom i hate even having the thoughts of being frustrated with her because i always think gosh i don't wanna get mad at her and then something happens to her the next day but she gets kinda intrusive <laughter> i don't know <laughter> oh i know um after the semester ended when i noted that i  you know i did well in school 'cause i had been it had been a long time since i went to school so when i received my grades you know a and a b i was like wow okay i can do this and it made me happy and that was about a few weeks ago i guess mhm thank you my mom i know it's good and bad <laughter> i mean for the most part my mom's been a positive influence you know it's just sometimes you know she gets a little like she wants to re-raise me or something like she doesn't understand that i'm an adult i'm gonna make my own decisions now and  pretty much have to let me do what i need to do <sigh> a lotta  heavy breathing <laughter> i mean i walk sometimes when i get a lil' frustrated whatever i'll just go take a walk you know or um just try not to think about it thank you <laughter> yes yes the navy i was nineteen yeah <laughter> yeah i didn't have any other options <laughter> i am i probably should've stayed in a lil' longer i was only in for four years but  you know i wanted to experience life outside the military so i did my enlistment and then i got out it made me a little bit more responsible than some of my friends that you know did not join the military i can notice a big difference as far as you know how i live my life and how they live theirs um just made me a little bit more responsible thank you <laughter> i worked in the medical field for about five years and uh oh thank you <laughter> but um it wasn't for me i wanted to do something lil' bit different i didn't wanna do patient care i wanted to work with people but not necessarily as a patient care provider so i started going to school and then i met my husband i stopped going to school got married and i started working in a telecommunications field and then we you know conceived our child and after that you know <laughter> <laughter> i think i'm caring well i know i am i'm very caring you know i'm very honest  to a fault sometimes you know i try to be as honest as possible with people sometimes it can hurt their feelings but you know you gotta be honest you can't let people think that you know you're not trusting and if mm yeah probably i don't i never really thought about it i don't know <laughter> maybe i don't really think about it i just try to be the best person that i can be you know so all i can do i can't live for what other people think i can only do what i need to do <laughter>  um i don't know <laughter> i never really thought about it  i guess it just you know being around my kids you know i just love being around my children and that's always puts me in a good mood <laughter> thank you okay like i said a lil' tired you know but you know for the most part okay you know i'm dealing with situations that well i go to bed really early so long as i go to bed early i get a good night's sleep but i wake up early as well so <laughter> it's kinda like good and bad a lil' bit i go to bed like eight eight thirty and then i wake up at like one one thirty so <laughter> very moody very irritable short short-tempered i guess if anything i think i'm thinking more positively you know like i said especially with my son having a disability you know i i look at it as if you know it's not all bad i mean he has challenges eh but i'm dealing with them a lot better you know as opposed to feeling sorry for him or feeling sorry for myself you know i'm just finding more avenues to work with him you know different resources to help him as opposed to just feeling guilty or sad and depressed about it thank you no occasionally who doesn't <laughter> i don't know can we skip that question <laughter> <sigh> green <laughter> seems to be the word kinda like um yeah probably green like naive a little <laughter> but at the same time smart i think she'll describe me as smart  mhm yeah okay no problem bye,0

344,yes i'm okay  i'm from uh los angeles california originally  yes sunshine uh the weather's great  it's about it smog pollution crime um  certain things like that yeah  i did in one point in my life i was in the military so don't do hardly a lot of traveling no more  seeing different sights different people i think it's more the people and being around different types a city and the people <peop> see meeting different new people  uh <sigh> i traveled to uh  new york one time and uh it was quite different big city  different people  uh that's about it  eighteen  uh yes i was <laughter>  uh no i did a lot of combat training but no combat  mm disciplined more uh more motivated uh you get a lot of things done more <laughter> even when you don't wanna do 'em you know you just go back to your army days and you get motivated off the stuff that that that you really needed to get done but you didn't wanna do it but it got done uh like uh  you had to uh do a lot of cleaning uh you had to wake up pretty early you had to do a lot of p_t you had to uh stay up to like two three o'clock in the morning you didn't wake back up until four or five yes <y> uh <laughter> to a certain point yes  after the military i joined the national guard and i did uh fifteen sixteen years in there uh i was uh excuse me ma'am i didn't hear that <th> quite hear that uh what made me decide to do that  uh just the motivation just you know really wanted a career see if i could find a career from it and it helped me out a little bit yeah    thank you  it wasn't that easy  uh i mean i'm sorry it was easy it didn't bother me too much to go back to civilian life  yeah it didn't bother me at all i just <ju> i adjusted pretty well  uh <sigh> history basically a lot um  yeah just basically history  uh no i'm not i'm uh disabled oh no it's okay it's okay we can all i can heal i can get better hopefully i will  yes i try to keep a  excuse me ma'am i guess i don't  my dream job would probably be working with others working with young people working with kids seeing that they get the uh the right and proper uh uh education that's you know that's due to them so they can be productive in the life of society as we live in today  yeah  excuse me  <sigh> what i think about 'em i think uh they should uh be more more uh <sigh> xxx i mean they should they should <sh> participate <tapicitate> more in what they're doing in their lives they should ask more questions they should be more motivated to uh really achieve something within their lives to give them the mm to give them the confidence and the motivation they need in life 'cause a lot of 'em don't get it <sigh> when i see people do really really stuff that they really shouldn't be doing  uh <sigh> it really eeks me i mean really bothers me and when people talk to you they give you the run-around it's like won't you just be straight with me instead of just giving me the the run-around <laughter> won't you just be straight up with me that can be very frustrating uh and really when people do really i'm trying to find the right word stupid stuff <laughter> that really botthers me too   uh spray painting on the wall  uh just throwing garbage anywhere and not picking it up uh not really being uh you know not really being  hygiene you know taking care of yourself and being hygiene you know what i mean  yeah  <sigh> what i do when i'm annoyed uh i get really upset i really start really cussing people out to be honest with you and it's something that's not really me but uh i'm learning to really let go of it a lot you know just you know just say hey that's the way it is it's like i'm not in control i can't control it yeah i have only have to control the things about what i do and really getting upset off of what other people do is not really good it's not good for me oh my temper can be controlled i can control it pretty well  uh  i i don't know i think it probably was my sister and she's very controlling and it's like you have your life and i have mine don't tell me what to do yeah  we real close i can get along with 'em we're real close i have no problems with them   yeah very good  uh  this morning <laughter>  yeah i wake up pretty you know i i first thing i do when i wake up in the morning i pray so when my spirit's in connection with the uh <sigh> the universe and the world i i feel pretty good   yes  uh <sigh> up and down you know up because i'm motivated to get out and start doing other things in life than just not doing anything at all and then other times where you wanna get something accomplished and you can't really get it done because there's road blocks in the way but uh i'm learning how to uh overcome those road blocks as well uh  well for instance uh looking to go to school and i was having problems uh getting enrolled in school i was talk to one of my social workers and she was willing to help me get online and uh to do it so i'm like okay it's well it's gonna get done <laughter> yeah  uh can you repeat that one more time ma'am  uh yes i have  see i had to be uh <sigh> i'd say uh for the last couple of weeks uh i noticed that i go through certain situations like you was talking about the anger situation it's like i don't get angry all the time that's not me so sometimes when i get angry i have to find out what's causing all this what's what's causing me to get angry  and i have to take  excuse me ma'am  uh it's not hard at all 'cause alls you have to do is just take your time and reflect about everything uh that you have gone through and uh take a good look at the situation and uh and then go from there and find out what's what's really bothering you  it's very seldom  uh i suffer from p_t_s_d and uh getting that type of sleep would be would be great  because i have recurring nightmares so of a incident so  <sigh> i i think it is and i don't know what it's triggered by but i think it is and that's why i'm talking to someone or seeing someone 'cause i'm a veteran  at the uh v_a about the situation now about the p_t_s_d basically right now  excuse me ma'am  uh <sigh> a lot of nightmares lot of problems lot of anger issues uh depression uh i noticed all this in me and uh i started i just started to just tell myself i needed help  and that's that's basically it i just you know i just you know i just something wasn't wrong with it something wasn't right with me  and when something's not right with me i have to take time out to just you know take a good look at myself and ask myself if something's right then you if something's right then that's fine if something's not right then you need to take care of it   and uh i just started seeking help down there yeah  somewhat yes it is somewhat  'cause i'm able to sit down and talk to the therapist  well i'm able to sit down and talk to the therapist and uh tell 'em my situation and we usually will go over the problem and uh i went to classes i've been to uh uh talking one-on-one with my own doctor so it's helping out a little bit  yeah  it's a good thing excuse me ma'am no no not really  my best friend  uh they he would describe me as a fun loving good person always there that try to help others uh  think more of others really than more of myself but when i know i need things need to be done for me i take care of it so you know and they really actually they really look up to me they have a lot more respect for me yeah they see something in me they wish that they had   excuse me ma'am uh can you be a little bit more specific  oh okay  uh books crossword puzzles uh walking that's about it  i thought i did but i don't think i do i don't think i regret anything because  this is this is how it is this is the way it is for me so i accept it and i keep moving on  because if i regret anything in the past then i'm wasting my time on that because it's gone that's the past i need to move on i need to live in the present so i can be prepared for the future so i can move on to the future  yeah  <sharp inhale> uh <sigh> more education uh  being more direct and more confidence in what i'm doing like i am today so yeah that's what i was lacking maybe twenty years ago  uh yes <ye> yes i have had a lot of positive people been been in my life  uh <sigh> yeah some people would uh uh uh well consistently <cons> xxx i mean consistently motivate me to continue and to pursue a certain goal and uh i thought that was pretty good because i really don't see that a lot and uh he gave me a lot of motivation to try to go up and try to do certain things 'cause anything that you do it's a choice it's up to you whether or not if you do it or not that choice is still up to you for it to be done   excuse me ma'am  uh <sigh> that i'm able to really be able to be self-motivated and really be able to put my best foot forward and be able to get a lot of things accomplished which i thought i couldn't but it can be accomplished if i'm willing enough to put the will to it to do it oh wow huh  oh really and you know what i really enjoyed was sitting down with my social worker and we're talking about getting things done within my life and school was one of 'em uh  and just being just school was one of 'em and i kinda liked it that because that was the first time someone was willing to really sit down with me and work with me  yeah and i thought that was a great thing so as long as you're willing to do that i'm willing to go even the extra mile and even be motivated to do other things besides school and uh yeah that and that and that's what gets me going oh it is and i love it and uh this is going to be accomplished  thank you  goodbye ,1
345,hi yeah i'm okay  i'm doing great  yeah  um i am from los angeles i was born in santa monica yeah um i like um  i don't know there's nothing i mean i don't really like it here that much but i

crowds make me really nervous and i don't like um all the smog pollution all that stuff <laughter>  no i don't i don't travel i haven't been anywhere really so <laughter>  um i studied um psychology when i went to s_m_c i took a psychology class so um i was psychology major i took an anthropology class and i took math but i'm not good at math <laughter>  no i uh i currently am not at school right now um yeah i'm just at home <laughter>  my dream job would be um i would like to help other people as long as it's something helping other people uh i would like to help other people with like p_t_s_d and problems and stuff uh yeah just as long as i'm you know helping other people smile and you know relating my problems with other people  um i'm pretty <pr> i'm close well i'm really close with my grandma um eh my family it's just eh we're not like too too close we kinda argue a lot <laughter> yeah  um sorry what's an introvert  okay  when i'm annoyed um well i try to relax for a minute i usually just try to take deep breaths but it's hard <laughter>  yeah  i'm not so good at it uh my temper's gotten a little worse um i am not good at all at really controlling my temper um i need some help on that <laughter>  um no not really i mean no i guess it's not like as bad as like most people i've never like been in a fight or anything or yeah any of that  um i argued with my mom and sister yesterday it was just something stupid over like my sister is sitting was sitting in the front seat and she's a kid and it's like i'm i should be in the front seat so i just asked her to sit in the back and of course they start like yelling and arguing and it's like really annoying <laughter>  yeah it does thanks  my grandma she's always giving me encouragement and um she's a therapist a licensed therapist so she's always you know made it really really um  easy for me to have someone to talk to and i could always go to her so that helps yeah  yeah  my most memorable experiences well i had one really good experience um i went horseback riding and that was really really made me happy uh i love horses and nature that's the biggest thing that i love and it just made me so happy and so relaxed so that was a memorable experience <laughter>    um caring very caring always there to talk to um i don't judge i never judge i'm never cranky i'm never i never ever get like angry at anybody else just like my family you know but yeah just very nice caring and stuff <laughter> um things that put me in a good mood like uh music nature um i like to cook a lot i like to cook you know for my family talking puts me in a really good mood i love meeting new people meeting new people puts me in the best mood uh it's not easy um it's hard um sometimes it's it's really hard um   i don't usually sleep well so um yeah i have trouble falling asleep mostly  um i guess it's just like my mind will be racing a lot of you know sometimes it'll be flashbacks of bad memories um just you know thinking too much <laughter> um i don't know um i think just uh  stress you know a lot of stress every day just everyday stress uh yeah pretty much that's what triggers it <laughter>  um i just try to stay positive i try to think like okay well you know one day things will get better um   i just i try to call somebody and talk to them if i have trouble like my grandma  yeah  thanks when i don't sleep well um well i start to like cry a lot and i start to get really irritable um i get really depressed it makes me not feel well at all i get very uh it just is really really bad if i don't get sleep yeah  yeah  thanks yes i was diagnosed um three years ago  uh i just i didn't really know what was going on then i realized okay well they just diagnosed that and um i was like okay well this is the problem and it i just wanted help because it just when your mind is after you like that's like it's just awful to have your mind taking control of you like that  yeah  yeah it's hard  um yeah yeah i definitely always thought i had a problem i always thought something was like really wrong um i just always like kinda nervous around people like i never can really like look anybody in the eye 'cause i'm just so nervous my eyes are always kind of like racing and i um would have sweats if i was in the situation um that reminded me of the situation like i just try to avoid what reminds me and brings those flashbacks yeah  oh um i i've been feeling good i've been getting out more every day i'm trying to um i guess walking keeps my mind off my p_t_s_d symptoms so i'm trying to walk more that helps  thanks um yeah i have depression um yeah  um it helps yeah it actually does help me a lot um i currently don't have one right now i'm actually getting a new one in a few days though like it's kind of a mix-up but yeah it really really helps me  um i noticed that i've had less flashbacks and um i've been more relaxed i guess and um yeah just you know trying to keep more occupied yeah it helps  um the last time i felt really happy um i guess um i don't know um today 'cause i mean i'm glad to be part of this <laughter>  um most proud of uh well <sigh> um i'm trying to think of what i'm most proud of um  i  think i'm most proud of like the fact that i am able to you know not be like well i mean most people i know they like deny that they have a problem and i'm proud that i can actually

and i'm glad to get help because i don't wanna feel that way and i wanna get help for the problem instead of doing that  oh gosh there's a lot i regret yeah there's a lot um i regret you know uh drug abuse you know but that's part of you know the p_t_s_d i regret um a lot uh mistakes you know relationships stuff like that  wow um i would've told myself to um i guess the advice i would've given

346,yes  i'm okay  here in los angeles  there's a lot of things to do i love the beach  um i love the i love that it's sunny all the time  um the amount of people  um  that's really about it the amount of people  just a little  i just like um going to new places and just discovering new things  um i recently went to new york i was there for about three months  um and it was extremely boring i went to western new york  um and it was extremely uh snowy and um  i didn't <didn> was in a position where i didn't have a car so i didn't get to go very many places and i was in a small town   so um  i uh  uh it was beautiful for what i got to see but really  it wasn't really much to it <laughter>  yeah  um  both i'm both an introvert and an extrovert  um  i really enjoy doing things by myself  um  i um have a lot of my own um my likes and dislikes and i've spent a lot of time alone even though um i have <ha> i do have a lot of friends and uh when i do go out i i do tend to meet a lot of people but um i also enjoy um being by myself a lot  um  probably outgoing creative um  talented  um fun trustworthy  um  i studied language um  and um physics  and um  math no i'm not  i'm actually um i'm um i'm trying to be an actress  it was something that i fell into when i was a teenager  scrubbed_entry and uh i really enjoyed doing it and i hadn't done it for years um  so i figured why not i just came back to california and might as well try something that i did enjoy really doing   um so far um i just got picked up by an agent  so i haven't really done anything yet as an adult  but um  i'm hoping  hoping something it'll be fruitful   um  <sigh> i really don't haven't had too many  um  i guess my sister she's done really well  um  my boyfriend he's a  he's a very positive human being  um  but um  really i haven't had too many positive influences  um  i'm close i mean we <w> we hang out um i i don't tell them everything  um they're kind of judgmental  but um  other than that i mean i mean we hang out i mean i see them every day  um  geez um  it's kinda hard for me to relax um i mean i try to watch t_v um and i read  a lot um  that's probably about it i read i do a lot of sleeping <laughter> i'm a little depressed so um  yeah it's kinda it's xxx like i said it's really hard for me to relax  um  it isn't  um i tend to think a lot  um about the things that stress me out  um i've been through a lot of a lot of stuff so um  yeah so i i don't i don't i don't sleep very well at night and if i do fall asleep i wake up all through the night usually with some kind of anxiety attacks  um  i dream a lot about um the stuff that has uh  has affected me throughout the years so um  it's usually you know like i i'll dream about something that stressed me out and then i'll wake up and my my chest'll hurt    um  or just i just can't sleep all night because i just think i seem to be i don't know if i'm afraid to go to sleep  but i uh <sigh> i just i don't know i feel like that <th> that's a vulnerable place for me  because of stuff that've happened to me  so um  i i so i sleeping is just not really something i do well  um  tired  i'm uh  i'm moody i'm very sensitive  um  i uh i'm just negative <ne> a negative person  um which really that's not me um  i uh yeah i'm like <l> judgmental is not me either um i just  i'm just not a not a nice person to be around  um  i try to <t> i i spend a lot of my time reading i try to go out and do um i force myself to go out and do things um  just to keep myself involved  um so that i don't uh sit <si> just sit around and and and dwell on the fact that i can't sleep and i i try to um get myself as exhausted as i possibly can  um by running around and and and doing things  so  um it's difficult  um i do like there is a part of me that doesn't wanna  i don't really wanna go out and do things i have to actually force myself to um if i have make appointments i uh  i make appointments to like for auditions or or um  even to do this i um i i tend to uh  just not  like at the last minute i'll i'll try to convince myself not to go <laughter> but then i force myself to anyways   yes  um i've been diagnosed for two instances  um i was diagnosed <dia> diagnosed about three years three and a half years ago  and then i was diagnosed again um in august um  the first time it was um  i just wasn't sleeping <sl> because of the not sleeping um   and the uh just the stress <st> the unbelievable stress  um  and then the second time it was a xxx uh once again i started with the not sleeping um and then every moment of the day was just thinking about what happened to me um  and i just i i just couldn't take it anymore  so i i figured um  i was getting too gloomy i was getting like um  not thinking life was worth it and and i i i that's i just needed to see somebody before anything escalated  yeah  it was  i no <n> do not um one of the reasons i went to new york was to try to um  get out of my environment  um and uh  and that seemed to help a lot  um  and uh out here i i was i just the counselors that i was going to just didn't really seem to be helping me much  um they just  they just seemed to be giving me a lot of medications and i don't believe that that's what i needed  um  yeah so um  yeah  <sigh> stressed um uh lately i've been really sad and i don't know why   um  but like i said i've been trying to combat that by um   keeping myself busy  um  actually um  i'm kind of a couple days ago  i was actually really happy and i was genuinely happy   um but then i went back to  being you know going back to feeling miserable  so um  well i realized  i got up in the morning i actually did get a good night of sleep  and um  i realized uh that i'm actually really lucky  um 'cause i've been through a lot in my life and i have um somebody in my life who really loves me and somebody who um is finally there for me  and uh  you know he gives me what i need emotionally and i was just really thankful for that  and that made me really happy  um  yeah  thank you <laughter> oh geez um  i've had so many years of just  just bad just a lot of bad  that it there has it's been a long time  since i've been proud of anything  i guess if anything it's my ability to survive through all the hardships i've been through  um my <m> a lesser person i guess would've  gotten rid of themselves a long time ago  but um even though like i'm really depressed and i feel gloomy and i feel <fe> just feel miserable about a lot of things um  there's gotta be a silver lining  so  um so yeah so i mean like i guess that's what i'm proud of that uh  i although a whole bunch of bad things have happened to me it hasn't ruined me i still try to be a good person um i i try not to be negative towards other people  and um  and truthful and i still i still have drive in me  yeah  ugh <sigh> so much um  my last marriage um not getting out when i should have  um  and uh just i regret a lot <sigh> um the any situation that would've had a red flag um  eh just get out of it you know eh some things just don't work and um  no matter how hard you try no matter how much you put into it so um  i i would tell myself um to um  that it's not selfish  to let go of a bad situation  and um not everybody can be helped so sometimes you just gotta live for yourself and help yourself  so if had i known that then had had i known that then i i i probably would've done better in life so  yeah  <sigh> um people who um  when people are down on me for my faults  um that i have done that i have things that i've done in my past that people steal still relive when i'm trying to forgive myself um  people who are mean to other people uh people who talk poorly about people behind their backs people that are untrustworthy um just anybody who picks on the little guy  um  you know people who don't care about the environment or animals um  i just <jus> i think that everybody should be as good as they possibly can be  and uh it's it's disheartening and it it just makes me so mad that people just can't be people don't let people live people try to make um everybody feel as negative and as poorly as they do  and uh i that makes me mad  <laughter> i vent <laughter> um  yeah i tend to vent and then uh  and them um and then it's usually over i try not to bad mouth people um i try to just talk through it until um until it's gone and then it doesn't bother me anymore mm i try not to get angry um  because i have a really bad temper and it um  and it can get outta hand so um  what i do is i i <laughter> something gets me so mad i tend to go and take a nap  um <laughter> if i'm not in that situation where i can just go and take a nap um i usually just walk away from the situation and i try to clear my mind and come back to it  um  it was a couple days ago it was actually with my mother um  it was about um  actually she thought that i had taken a shirt from her  and um she was screaming and yelling at me and um  i was i was tired um i was it was late and um  i started to yell at <a> back at her you know because i was hurt that she would accuse me of something so petty um  and you <yo> <sigh> it's uh going back to my past you know when i was younger and you know i didn't care about you know people's things and i would just kinda take and do whatever i wanted to and i'm not i'm so far from that person   um and i it it hurt me so i got mad and i and i started to yell and argue  mm kinda petty and stupid but  at the time it it seemed  it seemed uh  viable  um  hmm one of my most memorable experiences  um  god <go> i've had so many um  maybe it was um  i don't know um  it was  probably um  graduating pharmacy school  um i felt pretty great i didn't know if i was doing  uh very very well or not um and i ended up getting like on my last test scores i getting <get> ended up getting like ninety eight percent  and um  i uh  i actually i didn't <did> i had no confidence <laughter> that i had done well in class in school at all and i i didn't even know how i was getting the grades i was getting um so that was a really big accomplishment for me um  and uh yeah that was a great it was a great memory yeah  yeah  um  i'm reliable  um  i um  i'm talented  um i i'm a good listener um  i'm always there to help people  um  i tend to always try to do the right thing  um  sometimes actually i forget that i have any good qualities but  um  and just  i uh  all around i try to be you know as as good and the best person that i can be to other people and myself um  yeah  um  going to comedy shows  um  just um  having moments where you just laugh with people  um  sometimes just reading puts me in a good mood uh  i don't know probably that's about it  uh huh  okay  thank you  bye,1

349,yeah  so so <sigh> nebraska  uh work i've been coming here off and on for years but officially moved here couple years ago  um  some good days some bad days i i guess i've gotten as used to it as i'm gonna be i don't know if that makes sense but  um <sigh> accessibility to to different things um as compared to nebraska um you know more opportunities to do different things and and explore different things  areas of interest uh the crime um  attitude <laughter> um  uh lack of lack of uh  uh work ethic lack of uh  kindness in people um cut-throat  yeah  i used to quite a bit  uh sense of freedom  the uh the adventure  um okay  you want me to tell you about a trip <laughter> uh egypt  i  yeah  uh i went with my mother and some family friends we went on an eight day cruise down the nile saw all the uh pyramids in giza um just it was just a incredible adventure just to get away from everything and everybody and and uh close friends and just have a great time  yeah  um not really at all  um just uh uh have history of um abuse and and neglect and uh just not a real functional family dysfunctional is is definitely a keyword in our family so  thank you um no not really i'm talked about it a lot before um so  i'm okay with it  <sigh> um <sigh> <laughter> it's really hard to say i haven't had very good uh uh very positive role models um um  ask me the question again  <sigh> well maybe at best my mother  but uh she's a she's also been a negative uh aspect of my life but um  uh yeah i guess i can't really identify anybody who's been a real real positive influence in my life  um the the trips that i've been on  um i used to  work out i used to do yoga i used to um  i used to meditate i used to exercise and i used to um i used to do a lot of things lately um i find it uh hard to relax i don't have the same uh  the same outlets that i did before the same uh i <ss> i i don't pursue them as much anymore i guess i'm i've lost my motivation or something i'm depressed about it you know i guess there it is right there  um pretty good i i is temper as far as getting to the point of uh uh physicality i don't ever that um  uh but i stand my ground and um but i can control my temper i i i never lose control really   um <sigh> the last time  uh probably  um as recently as you know  in the last month or so i maybe argued with um  uh an acquaintance over um  uh <laughter> uh i don't know i i have to come back to that question  no no yes um  well officially october of last year but i've i think i've been depressed longer than that but officially october of last year  um  actually i was uh being treated for other medical issues and um my depression was notable to the doctors so yeah  yeah  um  well i've never been suicidal but just to just to just in i i just often have thought um  eh that i don't have much reason to to live i used to think i had a purpose and such but um i don't really have anybody in my life um  who i think cares enough about me uh  that i really <rea> if i was even dead uh so um i've kind of lost myself  and um i used to that used to be enough  that i was um enough to uh  you know to to have purpuse in my life but um  i've lost quite a bit of that  motivation <motiv> yeah  well i'm trying to pull it together i'm trying to um  <sigh> get back a sense of me  i get inspired every once in awhile but um overall i just don't seem to be making much progress  yeah  i wouldn't really call it therapy i don't have a therapist per se i have a a nurse practitioner who prescribes medication for me and nobody really to talk about psychosocial issues  um i uh huh  did you say that sucks eh  okay  and uh yeah  um overwhelmed preoccupied um  just uh trying to stay alive stay on top of things  no uh  easy when i can i don't um  yeah when i if i get a chance to fall asleep i don't have any problem with it  um even more distracted and uh um  um even more  uh lackluster i guess is the word  whatever uh if i had a best friend um <sigh> i don't know um <sigh> he maybe lot of positive adjectives before but now just you know just uh some people say i should be proud 'cause i'm surviving a hard time or some people think that uh  i'm a a loser  <laughter> so um i don't know <sigh> maybe um  a survivor uh persistent um um well i used to be proud of my career and um  kinda giving back to people giving back to society um 'cause i was given  a lot it felt like um <sigh> so i'm just proud to uh  i don't have much of a sense of pride anymore to be quite honest i i've um it uh i don't know <sigh> <laughter> psychology and um  well initially yeah  um no not really per se although my current career involves a lot of uh  psychology a lot of um  uh the aspects i don't know what i'm trying to say um  it's a part <p> it's a part of it but it's not the center of it  um well i guess if my career is still going i'm in uh nursing but um i've been sick lately and with depression and other healthcare problems i  uh have uh found it necessary to apply for disability social security income  and i'm starting the process of that 'cause i'm not working   very <sigh> educating people um making a difference i mean i used to i had i've had my dream jobs i've had my dream jobs i don't uh  i don't know what the future will hold for for uh work but um  something i suppose working with people again health uh helping in some way  um no but lately with the depression more so at times i used to say that i never regretted anything 'cause i would make the best decision of all things in front of me but um  i just wish there were times then that um  the choices that i would have were  <laughter> were better 'cause some choices that i seem to have made or were made for me have um made my world kind of shitty   for lack of a better word shitty  what i don't understand  <sigh>  to be strong to um believe in myself  to remember that i've survived a lot of things and i will survive this too   to get up off my ass and move to um <sigh> to have confidence faith  um <sigh> i just murphy's law has kicked my ass   so much you know i just uh  it it seems like when i've tried to make my world better i just keep getting knocked down um so it it's almost like i'm i don't wanna give up but um every time i try and move forward i get knocked back and it gets gets exhausting  and i don't have any support system really nobody not really  <sigh> um  loyal um hardworking  um  dependable  um  uh capable um well at least i used to be uh  intelligent  comtemplative um eh uh deep not a superficial person um  yeah i guess those are some of them  many years ago  um i used to have a lot of confidence i used to be pretty dynamic person i used to be people would <wou> say <s> used to say that i was the most centered person that they knew and i used to help people and i'm now in their shoes and i don't seem to be able to help myself  <sigh>  <sigh>  i can't think of anything right now <laughter> i can't think of really anything right now  i don't do much anything for fun anymore i used to however um go to movies and and entertainment venues and travel go to dinner with friends do things um but lately i don't i don't really have any pursuits   a good day a happy day a fun day for me is a day without something going wrong  basically  <laughter>  mhm yeah  bye,1
350,yes  i'm doing fine thank you  originally i'm from well i was born in mississippi so i'm from gulfport mississippi  yes  i didn't have a choice i was a child i moved here with my parents  <laughter> uh when i was two years old  <laughter> yes i was i was a toddler  yes i like to travel and i travel a lot  um being around new environments and new people uh different things  <cough> um well one of my favorite trips was visiting africa in i think two thousand six i visited uh west africa and that was a great trip for me it was a medical mission where we volunteered and gave medical assistance to people  a friend of mine uh was actually involved and she talked to me about getting involved so i went in with her and it went from there so i don't know i made the decision that way   i am i am happy i did that it's something i'll never forget <laughter>  i studied english and education so that i could teach high school students  uh not currently no well right now i um tutor privately for a private tutoring company and looking to get back into the classroom working as a teacher  mhm wow anything that uh combines teaching traveling and writing would be a dream job for me so yeah anything that combines those three items so teaching has the closest outcome to that    um  occasionally yes <laughter> um <clears throat>  i don't know i guess in comparison to others that are considered outgoing um and and a lot of people have said i seem reserved or kinda introverted i don't know   mm well  i don't know i read um i just started meditation  mm try to breathe and calm down <laughter> yeah  some things that make me really mad um  mistreatment of children  abuse of children  um try to figure out what's annoying me usually and then go from there uh if i can control not being annoyed like ultimately i control that whether or not i'm annoyed so try to figure out what the problem is and then go from there and not be annoyed <laughter> if i can help it all  oh i'm fine i can totally <to> in at controlling my temper i think so i don't have a yeah    the last time i argued with someone  was um  i don't know maybe a couple of days ago and it was about um it was about um a smell they had on their clothes but i thought smelled like perfume and they said it did not so <laughter>  yeah  <laughter> this is cool uh i think i'm very close to my family we're a pretty close knit family talk every day um see each other almost every day  there've been a lot of positive um influences in my life i would say my aunt and uh definitely my mother have all been positive influences  well um i look i look <l> i uh <clears throat> look up to my aunt um i think she's positive i look up to her  because obviously we grew up with very similar backgrounds came from very similar neighborhoods and areas and she's very successful um despite the types of things that we've gone through as children  and um she doesn't let her past define her future uh my mom's overcome so many obstacles as well um she had some challenges with her health but she still tries to be optimistic and she's still tries to   you know overcome these things and just still live our life despite some physical barriers that she might have so i look up to people who are able to  you know not allow their current situation to dictate their future because anything is possible   no i have not  no i have  um well i was diagnosed um within the last um year and uh then again most recently within the last three months  well um fear and just not knowing what to do with uh some of the things i was feeling and not knowing um you know why i couldn't stop feeling the way i was feeling  there were a lot of symptoms um  um you know mostly i uh i gained a lot of weight um i couldn't sleep a lot and then sometimes i could sleep too much <laughter> um  felt sad sometimes  like i wanted to cry a lot  i've been feeling okay um there are days yeah um i don't know every day is different so i mean today i feel fine but like i said everything is differently lately i've been feeling um more like i can be involved <inv> involved in my own life and like i wanna get   out and do more things  um  no no it's no no i haven't  not any different from before what i was experiencing before  no  mm well mm i was receiving um  uh i guess psychotherapy and um i don't know a lot of things happened i moved for a while to go take care of my grandmother and i just kinda  got more involved in taking care of other people instead of myself for a while  uh sometimes  i do  yes it is it's kinda difficult um i either have a hard time falling asleep or a hard time staying asleep i'm sure it is i just don't know what it is as of yet because i you know <sniffle> usually it's um thoughts continual thoughts running through my mind that either keep me up or make it hard for me to uh go asleep or make it hard for me to stay asleep mhm um journal sometimes uh that might help if i can write some things down and get it out that helps other than that i don't you know i haven't found any really great ways of coping  it tired <laughter>  yeah mostly uh tired um kinda confused  i don't know for the most part i feel happy it's just um   last time i felt really happy was i guess over the holidays  uh i don't know i guess the just being around uh family and friends just the holiday season i guess in general that's just a happy time for me and seeing people i haven't seen in a while um that's about it  how would my best friend describe me probably as um  quiet sometimes cautious talkative sometimes um tenacious  um i don't know a lot of my friends say that they look up to me for uh some of my accomplishments and they also say that they are grateful to have me as a friend because i'm caring and compassionate or um easy to talk to um that i remind them of a of <o> feel like a sister to them  <laughter>  um everyone has regrets i'm sure yeah i regret stuff  to just  relax and be yourself and just go ahead and it sounds cliche and i don't mean to sound that way but it's true it's just um you have to learn how to be comfortable with you and relax and just know you um to not compare yourself to other people because what someone else is doing or where they may be in their life at a certain time is not necessarily where you are supposed to be or what you're supposed to be doing at that time it doesn't mean that you're less competent or less able to do it it just means that everyone has their path and everyone has their  their time and their progression to how they get to things so i would tell me ten years ago to just believe in me and stay on my own path for what it is that i want for my life and don't be  yeah  um really enjoyed working with um well  okay a science project <laughter> with um my younger uh relatives my cousins we did a science project together and it was fun despite the mess we made it was a ball um being the first to attend college in my family and then um going to college and coming back to the community where i uh went to school and then teaching in that community and volunteering in that community and helping um youth or children that come from the same background that i came from so  uh i'm most proud of being able to  have the opportunity to improve and better myself and then to come back and help someone else improve and better themself as well   goodbye ,1
351,yes <clears throat> okay um new york um to pursue um music industry a job in the music industry  uh yes i'm self-employed um to become a music producer um it's pretty hard there's a lot of competition <laughter> um to pursue a job uh when um about a year ago last february it was pretty difficult east coast is a lot different than the west coast um i think i've been there twice in the past year no i'm more of a creature of habit um yes uh sometimes i feel like i don't fit into the crowd so um it's better just sometimes to be more quiet and view everything instead of uh you know going in and actively pursue things um <laughter> probably uh listen to music um and spend time with my dogs um <clears throat> probably um people being insensitive <insen> um not very um very nice to me or um seeing injustices or um i think that's about it <laughter> um pretty good you know sometimes <so> um probably couple of days ago um one of my friends was saying that um mm uh they were making a comment about how i am and i got kind of upset about that yeah it does <laughter> pretty close um my best friend so i um oh just one of my friends um i kind of am quiet about it and when a person pushes me to a certain point that's when i overreact usually um it's pretty hard um i rather the person notice that i'm kinda getting withdrawn and actively engage in me instead of getting it to the point where it's like um it it comes to a point where it blows out of proportion  um um probably spending time with my family in new york very close um my sister and my brother um i don't know they're just great people and i love them a lot and they're a lot like me so i feel like i have people that understand me um probably um i guess loyal um sensitive um <laughter>  i don't know it's kind of hard <laughter> it's a hard question <laughter> no no <clears throat>  yes gosh um i think probably nineteen ninety seven so a long time ago um i'm just uh during that time i was just going through a lot of issues and i was feeling unsafe to myself so i ended up going um to the doctor to kinda get meds and have therapy and stuff um not currently i i did about like six months ago um i just felt the therapist wasn't really helping me um i felt we kept on talking about the same things over and over and xxx she wasn't really challenging me and i've been in therapy for a really long time so i just knew it was a change it's okay <laughter> um yes i do actually um  when i feel connected to a therapist um and when i feel like it's a really great way for me to talk about what i'm going through um so yes i do um i'm better at describing my emotions and feelings i think the biggest thing is um when i'm in situations eh i can see myself reacting one way and i take a step back and see how i can react normally almost in a way um    also i tend to take a lot of my emotions and feelings and kind of bury them and make them feel like really bad about myself so it's nice to talk to someone that's not judging that doesn't really tell me like you know um they tell me it's o okay basically <clears throat> um feeling hopeless all the time not having you know enough energy to do things i used to like i had a little bit of concentration issues  um having weird disturbing thoughts sometimes just pop into my mind and just overall just feeling kinda crummy about life  um sometimes they are at  like random moments that if there's like a problem with like my interpersonal life or something like that or if i sometimes even seeing something on television um like sometimes that affects me  um listening to music or trying to distract myself um trying like my therapist told me for the longest time to journal to record things <clears throat>  um it's been a tough transition to come here so uh well being <be> being here um so um kinda half and half okay and not okay <laguhter>  um i feel like i've been a little bit with more withdrawn lately um but that's about it um <clears throat> some days it's great some days it's not um more recently it's been a little bit more difficult um i don't know why i have like a lot of thoughts on my mind at night <clears throat> so i tend not to sleep very well and i wake up quite frequently during the night <clears throat> um <clears throat> very groggy in the morning and um that's about it like during the day i tend to yawn a lot and my friends always are like oh why are you yawning so much are you disinterested <disisinterested> in what we're doing and then trying to tell them it's not that at all <laughter> um probably christmas time when i was with my family  um just really happy and um feeling like everything was alright in my life  having a good sense of like where i was at that moment being present with myself um probably you know um let's see that's a hard question i think probably i can tend to read people kinda well sometimes and um  uh i like to say uh i'm good at like being a good friend to people being a good family member um i'm a hard worker when i do have a job so <laughter>  um um sure i mean it's life so of course there's regrets um one that comes to mind is um the wish that i don't eat as much so i can be a lot more healthy <laughter>  um don't take things so seriously <laughter> um enjoy being youthful and um i think that's it <laughter> um i don't know that's a good question probably um my previous job and my employment i worked really well with kids um  so i did a great job at that i was um a researcher um at a hospital and i helped a lot of kids out for about six years so seven years  yeah it was awesome um i was really kind of like um  reading people and so i decided to major in psychology <clears throat> so uh and then i went a worked in a um mental health facility and did research um with them with um with drugs and depression and things like that so it found like a good niche for me <laughter> okay no problem <laughter> goodbye <laughter>,1
352,yes  i'm doing pretty good <laughter>  i'm from oklahoma  mhm yup oklahoma city  uh the weather is great i love being near the ocean and the palm trees and uh mountains i just love it here <laughter> um it was pretty easy there's a few differences it's a huge city compared to where i'm from so traffic has definitely been an adjustment for me <laughter>  um i just always wanted to live in california uh hated being landlocked in oklahoma just wanted to get out to the west coast be near the ocean   i studied psychology and minored in art  um no not at the moment  um well actually i think i misunderstood your question i'm not still working on my degree but i am working in the field of psychology i well i just got hired working at a group home for teenage boys who have been in trouble with the law  my dream job oh  i don't really know i think i just wanna help people however i can and um i just like working with people in the realm of psychology so i think i may already have my dream job <laughter> to relax i like to read or watch movies um i like to go to the beach and just watch the sunset or um hang out with friends  things that make me really mad um probably injustice towards other people um people being mistreated or abused um and people being lied to and deceived including myself i hate being lied to <laughter>  when i'm annoyed uh depends on the situation but i try to just like count to ten and take a deep breath and and not let my emotions cause me to react in a negative way so i just try and like calm down before i say anything  um it depends again on the situation and like who i'm angry with um most of the time i'm pretty good at controlling it but sometimes i think like like most people i'll lash out at the people that i'm closest to at times and and those moments i'm not that good at controlling it  <sigh> when was the last time i argued with someone it was probably with my parents um i've been having some some car trouble lately and i'm also running low on money so i'm sure i don't even remember exactly but i'm sure we kind of probably fought about the fact that i you know need to be more self-sufficient and independent take care of my own <laughter> things like car issues  i am very close with my family they're still in oklahoma but i talk to them on the phone all the time  oh definitely i mean my mom i think um she's probably the person that i'm closest to and she just  she's a great role model she's a wonderful person and she's very hardworking and very unselfish and i just wanna be like her in those ways  oh probably the time i went bungee jumping over the nile river in uganda um i still kinda have flashbacks of that moment just freefalling it was like the coolest experience ever and i love doing things that are crazy like that so it was a fun time <laughter> yeah well i have <ha> i have traveled a lot nowadays i don't travel so much anymore but i used to work for a cruise line um norwegian cruise line and so i would go travel all the time with them and then i also did an eleven month long trip around the world uh it was a mission trip so i just went and helped out in different third world countries it was really cool  uh i just love going to different places seeing new places and meeting all different types of people um because it's easy to just like get so absorbed in your own small bubble that you forget that there's a huge world out there and there's all different types of people with all different types of beliefs and it's just really cool to be able to branch out and see and meet those types of people and see just the diversity and the terrain of the earth even and the way that the earth looks in different places is cool  no i have not served in the military <laughter>  nope no i've never been formally diagnosed although i would say i've probably diagnosed myself with depression um just after having studied it a lot in psychology throughout the years i've i'm probably ninety nine percent sure that i've struggled with depression off and on so yeah   lately it's been pretty easy but throughout the years i've definitely had a lot of issues with insomnia um just like either not being able to fall asleep or just like waking up constantly throughout the night and so right now i'm not really experiencing too much of that but in the past it's definitely been an ongoing issue for me   i'm not a pleasant person when i don't sleep well sleep is extremely like important for me i think maybe more so than a lot of people i i like need good sleep to function  i've been feeling really good um  over the past several months i was unemployed um after coming out here and that was really really tough um and i just recently got offered my job um just like last week so i definitely think i've been going through a lot of crap and just a lot of depression but it's like lifted a lot of it has been lifted off me because i don't have that pressure any longer of like how am i gonna make ends meet this city's really expensive and i don't have a job and so i feel i feel much more relieved than i have been feeling which is good <laughter> um yeah well i mean just like i said over the past week or so i've become a lot more  positive i was kind of like feeling a bit like a hermit in a way it's just hard like being in a new city and not really knowing too many people and of course like i said not having a job kind of causes you to kind of just like be in your own shell i guess and that was kinda how it was how it's been for me and um just since i got offered the job i just have so much more confidence and like positivity that um things are are starting to work out for me which is good <laughter>    oh it was probably a couple of days ago actually i went um  i went to explore a part of the south bay area that i hadn't really been to before and it was i was just gonna go for a jog along the beach and it was really foggy outside and then the fog started to lift and um it was just beautiful and then i i went for a drive up off kind of off this like cliff where there's beautiful scenery that i'd never seen before and i just like was overwhelmed with how pretty it was and i was just like oh i can't believe that i get to live here so that was definitely a happy moment for me <laughter>  my best friend would probably say that i'm very daring and bold and fearless um that i'm unique and artistic and i don't i would guess that she'd probably say that i'm a non-conformist i don't really think the way that a lot of people do and i question everything so which can be a good or bad thing but yeah <laughter>  um  probably just like the fact that i i really try to live my life with like no regrets and just i try to live a very exciting life in a way and i think that especially ever since i finished college and have been traveling like i have and i've tried moving all different places by myself so i think just the fact that i i'm not really afraid i don't let things hold me back i just if i want something or if i wanna do something i can just do it and i guess in a way like i like that about myself and the fact that i'm really independent and can just go and do whatever i feel like doing even if it's hard i still i'm proud that i've overcome a lot of those struggles  oh there's like minor things that i regret throughout my life but there's not anything really major 'cause i think pretty much everything that i've done i've learned from whether it's good or bad so i wouldn't really change anything  oh <sigh> i would say i would tell myself when i was a kid that i  should just keep dreaming big and don't let anything that anyone says like stop me from believing that anything's possible because um i guess as i've grown into an adult i've really seen and started to really believe that truly anything is possible and if you really want something you can go after it and you can get it so i would just tell myself to never give up and just always believe that you can do what you wanna do  oh  let's see that's kind of hard <laughter>  um oh i guess i went home recently for christmas back to oklahoma and um i got to see some of my friends from college that i hadn't seen in some of 'em i hadn't seen in like since i graduated so um which has been like four years ago so um it was really awesome just to go out with them and we went to dinner and we went out afterwards and just had a good night and it was really really fun  cool you're welcome  bye ,1
353,yes  i'm okay  um pennsylvania  mhm um well i was in boston for a couple years and then i moved here about three and a half years ago but um i just wasn't satisfied with the quality of my life um maybe once or twice last year i only got to back once a year um definitely safer and um definitely a more um well i just miss it 'cause i have a lot of family back there but l_a is okay i i mean everyone loves the climate here um  not too easy i have two really good friends here and i have a boyfriend i've been with for three years so that helps he's from here but um it definitely took a a bit of adjustment  no um advertising communications  um no i'm currently working in actually i'm not working right now at the moment um i wanna be an osteopathic physician  um so basically versus western medicine an osteopathic physician is someone who helps someone with the symptoms and doesn't just treat the symptoms but treats them as a whole person so they look at nutrition they look at diet exercise um just a variety of things to <t> to actually get someone to live  a healthier life versus medications or things that are commonly prescribed now in the western medicine  um well one of the great things was when i came out here to l_a i was um exposed to the degree which i had never heard of living on the east coast   um sometimes  um well i'm very particular about the people i like to surround myself with um and eh i don't like to socialize with a lot of people i mean i tend to um like small intimate groups and i don't tend to like to be in larger or bigger groups um eh when people don't take into account other people's feelings  um i usually  try to go for a walk if i get <laughter> very irritated  um i'm usually really good it really takes a lot for me to spill over and to yell or become upset   um <sigh> let's see uh mm i was at with my lawyer and it was about his handling of my case  yeah it was he's uh they're i don't know i think they're just a little bit mediocre they're not the best lawyers   i have no idea <laughter>  um i'm very trustworthy i'm loyal um i care very deeply so i i like to try to help other people um and i always like to try to cheer people up so <laughter> i think that's that would be some of 'em  no yes  um just a few months ago about in the last six months  um i was experiencing  mental issues that i'd never really came across before paranoia and anxiety and i knew that it wasn't  um i knew that i it wasn't that i couldn't overcome it by myself  um a lot better i've been doing a lot of yoga and meditation um kinda seeing things from a different per view or another <ano> not per <pe> per view but a different view and um  that's helped but there's definitely times where i kind of sink back into thinking about the event especially because the event caused me to stop working   um  i think i you know i have a difficulty being in public um i'm still dealing with anxiety and paranoia about that and that something may happen so um so a lot of times during the day is when it happened so i'm not that comfortable going out during the day i tend to go out in the mornings and evenings and um i don't like to go into places where there's only one way in and one way out um well i've been gradually trying to increase how much i'm outside um  and i usually just deep breathing um i do a lot of breathing exercises and i just try to say that basically what i'm thinking or what's going on with me is not real um and that   i just i try <laughter> i just try to get myself to go into these places more gradually a lot better since uh the last couple months but before i very much pretty much stayed home    um  it's been good um it's been good to hear someone's feedback but um i feel like i've gotten more help with just my inner talk with just kind of sitting with myself and journaling  i do  um <sigh> well i feel like more like myself which is a huge improvement um and i am more cautious and er guarded in some ways about my thoughts um and about my decisions as well i'm not so i'm not so oh you know i'll just do this and not really think of the consequences of other things that i want in my life   um it's gotten better i'm okay <ok> i'm better now um the first three months it was very difficult i couldn't sleep through the night and i woke maybe two or three times and would be awake for a couple hours but now i am um sleeping through the night again  um i feel <f> groggy <sigh> k i feel foggy and out of it um  and just low kind of depressed  mm <sigh> it's um i think it's been awhile  um working <laughter> i'm a bit of a workaholic um spending time with my family um yeah just being outside enjoying nature reading um very close  what is that  um scrubbed_entry um well my parents 'cause they've always been very supporting and loving um giving me feedback about my decisions or what i'm choosing to do but allowing me to make my own um decisions my own choices in life and then  my sisters have just always been very um you know just always checking with me i'm the baby i'm the youngest in the family so they always um  looking out for me and just checking in with me and then my boyfriend xxx with this um incident that happened um he's been very uh usually supportive with just letting me kind of have my talk and work things out and understanding when i'm feeling and not wanting to go out in public and and being aware of that that it's not so easy for me just to do something like grocery shop or um running errands without having a lot of anxiety  um i'm most proud of  the jobs the work that i've done the people i've helped um  maybe that i took this job where i was assaulted at <laughter> that would be it going into retail into unsafe environment not listening to my gut  um  what advice would i what uh to recklessly pursue your dreams um that there is no such thing as too late or running out of time and and to enjoy every moment of your life not take anything for granted  um  let's see uh <sigh> well cooking i really enjoy <enj> i really enjoy cooking um  so i made some roasted vegetables just any time i'm cooking i just really enjoy it um we have a garden so we had collard greens that came up and um some chilis and cauliflower so just using preparing that for <f> um for my um boyfriend and i  mhm bye thanks ,1
354,yes i'm alright with this doing pretty good little bit tired i'm from los angeles the weather and the sports can't find any jobs right now i know um not really i studied um architecture and chicano studies and a little bit of history  uh since <si> i was <wa> little <li> since i was little i liked to draw and then i like to learn about history i'm trying to i'm going i'm working and going to school i'm trying to get my finish gettin' my degree playing in the n_f_l what was that um i don't know what that is eat or sleep people not doing they jobs walk away um pretty good like three days ago a couple days ago over some family issues um sure well um like to workout play football and ride my bike um walking on that u_c_l_a i felt big like i actually was doing something with myself my parents like they struggle <strug> they whenever they struggle they still manage to put through whatever they want and i'm pretty close real close uh quiet um my height and strength  mm no no no it's pretty hard uh i i get home late and i'm usually up for like fifteen to like eighteen hours during the day so by the time i get home i'm really not even that tired to go to sleep yeah uh if i don't sleep well i get i wake up grumpy or like not in the mood to do things  mm just like under pressure a little bit not that hard i just stress pretty much sometimes just working i really don't like working but i have to so  um a little bit like it's not i'm not like a little bit more violent but just a side <s> just a side effect from not playing football for a while music eating or and working out um i don't know raising my son and while i was still in school in high school no patience watching your son grow uh i have a five and a half year old boy i don't only see him on the weekend pretty close spoiled they're they're so advanced with everything that it makes the like their grandparents feel like dinosaurs while they already they just born and they already know how to use everything around their house can't treat 'em like kids anymore mm so you pretty much treat 'em like adults sometimes it works some it doesn't do it doesn't really work no should have just stayed on one path follow my dreams probably like or just follow what i wanted to do and that's about it a couple months ago um i was i was playing football i was playing for a junior college and we made it to the championship bowl that was probably the happiest i've been in awhile  good thank you bye,1
355,yes alright  i was born in uh los angeles california  uh well the weather and uh  the fact that uh people aren't so obtrusive like on the east coast  uh just the uh the traffic and the the smoggy weather  i used to i'm unemployed now so i rarely go anywhere  i have a b_s in uh business with a uh computer uh option i thought that the only place i could get a job with a business <bu> business degree was in accounting or in business computer methods so i took that i took business computer methods option  oh i'd probably be like uh a professional sports player or an actor something something that you enjoy doing  i like to uh ride my bike i like to watch sporting events now i can't afford to go to them so i pretty much watch on t_v  i like to travel but like i say that i don't have money for that anymore  that's alright  uh <sigh> people who are chicken heads they get their nose in other people's business even if they're just strangers you expect that from a family member or or a friend but you know especially with the internet that feeds a lot of that now we know what orwell was referring to when he spoke of big brother in nineteen eighty four  uh i don't do much much different than i would otherwise  uh and i've had many temper outbursts uh  i kinda argue with my aunt  and it was because she was basically  making leading statements trying to trap me into saying something about a relative and uh it annoyed me greatly   uh i'm kind of on the outs with my parents  i'm kind of the black sheep  oh uh i mean my mom's done the most to help me she's done a lot you know more than uh anybody by far well i mean she's just  i remember one time when i was in like thirteen i went with a friend of mine to see the crosby stills nash and young concert at the forum  and she has seven kids and she picked me up at the sizzlers right across the street from the forum at uh eleven o'clock at night and i couldn't imagine with all she had to do that day that she agreed to do that but she did  oh probably uh  going down to the cape at the end of uh baja peninsula there's cabo san lucas or taking <ta> photographing the bridalveil falls in yosemite  uh it was probably the two most majestic seen <see> sights i've ever seen  it was when i could afford to travel  no no i was diagnosed with depression after a hospital visit in april of two thousand eleven    and uh i took some lexapro but i stopped after one day i didn't wanna do it anymore  no because i didn't feel it was helpful i feel i was becoming a zombie  yeah  depressed about not having a job for over two years i lost my job in october two thousand and ten and except for day you know jobs like this which i'm fortunate to get just you know daily things focus groups like that i haven't worked  thank you  especially when you're fifty six years old  well mm eh just uh it just the i guess the general feeling of hopelessness   i get out on my bicycle a lot and walk or bike just four hours a day split about two hours each  yeah good to get some very easy  'cause now i'm old when i was young i couldn't sleep more than six <s> four six hours a night  because i'm restless  no but now that i'm old i i i sleep much more easily  i pray before i go to sleep and that's that's that's when i can't have any trouble sleeping i just pray recite different prayers like the lord's prayer hail mary stuff like that and i'm able to fall off to sleep  i don't know probably uh  can't have any specific remembrances  of of that you know it was when i had money to spend i know that and when i had to have a job to have money to spend so it was probably fifteen years ago  well i haven't really enjoyed anything uh last week i did a uh made seventy five dollars on a job with the the county basically it was an emergency preparedness exercise they were running for their personnel and they enlisted people to play the basically the relatives of people who had been in a in a fall uh bombing at the staples center and we you know asked questions signed up you know told 'em gave 'em the information i'm missing  you know relatives and basically it was provided by the county and basically went through a routine in downtown l_a  not not hard it was just uh just a routine we had to follow we had to act like we were actually missing somebody and had to give the specifics of their characteristics height weight etcetera    i don't have a best friend  uh  i'm uh very bright i'm a perfectionist at my job  i'd say that's about it  i got a business degree and i've never been a motivated person i went to school i went to two state colleges and two junior colleges to meet that end so i believe that was probably the most significant contribution <con> contribution that i i made to my  you know to my uh i guess self esteem you might say so i had something to hang on the wall  yeah i regret you know  alienating family members  i would've uh  basically not been so impetuous and left left jobs thinking <think> thinking that  you know i could always get another one and not you know basically blow off jobs i could probably work at one of the employers that i used to work for now  they've added locations but i burned bridges there so that's not possible  thank you  hasta luego ,1
356,yes  okay  from here from eh from alhambra  uh the weather's really nice and everything's very familiar  uh sometimes there's too much congestion on the roads too too much traffic  i i studied art and photography uh it it wasn't so much a decision i just kept noticing that i was very interested in it  yes  i'm a photographer  mhm oh i suppose uh  um running a family portrait studio or some other type of photography business  uh no not no i'm an also an apartment manager it keeps me tied down  um it's uh fair it's not the greatest because of being an apartment manager i've i do have free rent but i have to stay there a lot so  that part does the free rent part is very good  oh gosh my most memorable experience that's hard to say  um  well i mean there's good and bad memorable experiences  oh well i guess some s s s like sport success when i was in high school there was a few of the things that i was happy about and some art pieces i've made were memorable and  some bad things would be my father's death you know but those are very memorable not good though  uh  well my parents and my i i have a lot of brothers and sisters uh so <s> so the my family uh fairly close but they most of them live around l_a uh there's a few that are from far <f> distant <di> uh distant my brother lives in new york and   my other brother lives in maui <clears throat>  mhm oh mostly very talented <ss> um just um more involved in technology than maybe i was or am and they're um i think they're more of a hive mind than when i grew up just seems like they were all hooked into social media  uh go on a walk or watch television  or play with my computer  and uh um well  there's some <so> some uh  there's some kind of uh  injustices that happen in not not <n> not big deals but for example our parking situation got worse with some new district parking eh that's kind of upsetting and the city doesn't seem to wanna  uh make any exceptions or change some rules  and also uh some unfair things at work sometimes happen that are upsetting <ups> uh that are upsetting uh yeah i worked for <f> in school <sch> uh uh at a high school <sch> i worked at a high school dance uh this last weekend and when we arrived at the site   the people at the site said we couldn't set up all of our equipment and backdrops and things at the location where we were assigned to do it that we had to go outside  and then to get an okay to go inside because being outside we weren't prepared for nor <no> nor told in advance that we were to be outside um it delayed our setup time and that doesn't <does> wouldn't have bothered me except that on monday morning um the school called <call> called our boss and complained that we were late setting up when it when they told us to wait for them and we told them we would be delayed if we wait and did we still get a complaint so that that part is upsetting and  and our work doesn't back us up the at the office they just need to please the school to maintain the account so uh often when that something like that happens it means they will not send you out to work at that school again which to would translate into less payroll hours for the the photographers that were on that job  that's yeah that's how they do things so that that is upsetting  uh most of the time that will i i dust off my resume <laughter> and start looking for other situations that are that might be better um  yeah  uh pretty good <sigh> i i i usually xxx might uh i in the moment i don't really lose it but xxx later i might um vent or something like that but on the spot <sp> on the location i wouldn't do that  um well just today um we have a uh schedule <sc> tight schedule today and i have a friend that i'm car <c> sharing a car with today and uh we we were arguing where to go first  and um so we compromised and did most of her things and one of my things then after  this <th> this was one of the things is over then we're gonna do some more of her things so but it yeah  no post-traumatic stress syndrome is that what that is  uh no i have not yes  oh <sigh> i'd say nineteen eighty yeah i think believe it was nineteen eighty yeah  um well my father noticed some symptoms my father is just well he's passed away but he was a psychiatrist  um well i wasn't sleeping i was laying around the house  um i was waking up at noon <laughter> something like and i didn't have a um focus like for getting a job it wasn't clear enough uh i i remember some job interviews that i'd go to their front door and then i wouldn't go in <laughter> and i think that was all all part of depression  yeah i thought i had a problem but i didn't know what it was  no uh well eh i went for three years and then the psychiatrist said that  he thought that i was done <laughter> but uh and i and i i did get to a much better place i have to watch all the time to see what's going on with depression so i think i i'll have good days and bad days  um i think therapy makes you see what the um  like the i i thought of it as a filter or wearing a pair <pa> as if you were put on a depression pair of sunglasses you don't really you see everything through that so you have to kinda <k> i have to sort of try to take the those glasses off for a little bit and double check am i really perceiving these things accurately  or am i seeing it through a depressed viewpoint and i try to look for clues about that   i think i'm um slipping back a little bit uh uh i don't do well during unemployed periods i've noticed in my path in my past and um right now we have a work slow down so it's easy to slip back into sleeping too late or putting things off because the schedule's too wide open for for me for me personally as a depressed person i think that structure is really important it um it gets you out of bed and you have to get somewhere in time and deal interact with people is all those are all beneficial things for someone who's tends to be depressed   uh  well i don't know if it's changes as i a little bit i just tend to be focused on some things that are probably not that um uplifting let's say uh but it's more negative like i have <ha> have been sort of thinking about how um um soldiers in the past uh i don't know why but like the in during the roman era <er> era or the greeks <gree> ancient greeks how it would've been like to be in a in a frontline battle with  mm you know just crude <cru> kind of crude <cru> in my opinion crude weapons and no medical help and  the i don't know i seem <se> my mind seems to go there a lot where i'm just thinking about that and i've been looking <look> looking at it and reading books about that or um video clips on youtube and eh things like that or um some other things <thi> other uh kinda like terrible doom type themes like i was watching on the animal show like crocodile attacks and things like that  where probably shouldn't dwell so much on that  oh you mean in life in general yeah well i think i regret not finishing college i think i had a i think i was <wa> uh was going into depression right then and wasn't coping in my senior year very well and um didn't really i didn't get out of college with a degree although i was there seven years but uh so that's very that's a big regret that i have um  i think it would've been to um  at certain points i probably should've sought <so> um sought therapy and also probably some uh outside help just with um getting through finals just the logistics i had i was an art major and i had no car so   a a lot of the art projects and things were difficult to move back and forth and and also to uh meet at away locations i think it probably would've been worth it to   do whatever it took to get a car <laughter> at that time so  um  well i'm i've been told i'm very patient  and also i have um some original original artistic ideas   so  um those are those are good qualities i'm very loyal and and also um  you know i support my friends i'm fairly generous with them  so yeah  um let's see  xxx really enjoyed was i had a  i had a nice experience uh just uh photographing um a soccer game recently   i really enjoyed that so  mhm okay  it was my pleasure  thank you goodbye ,1

363,<synch> yes good how are you i am from los angeles yes um it's uh center of everything eh you can get to all the places you need to go to uh eh without having to drive very far um i like being in the city well being in l_a also you're dealing with traffic a lot of congestion and um obviously uh the environment as far as uh the air quality is not that great but you know you live with that um i was a business administration major so i studied business and um after i finished college i um uh pursued a career in retail operations uh no i as a matter of fact i am not i kinda changed career uh over the last four or five years so i'm concentrating more on the human resources side of the business um a couple of factors um i after working numerous years in the retail business i um switched over and worked in a uh creative business which was a graphic design firm and i uh captured a knowledge <knowl> a lot of knowledge um in the a in the human resources side because i was the operations manager slash benefits manager for a a small company yes i'm very happy i did that um i picked up on lot of knowledge and uh and it's very helpful <laughter> well my dream job is um i'm basically kinda doing what i wanna do now because i am a uh independent contractor i do freelance work as an h_r consultant using all the knowledge that i uh gained from previous jobs and um i utilize that with the flexibility to do the things i wanna do as far as personally and have the time i need to to do the things i wanna do and um obviously i worked hard early part of my career so the financial aspect of uh my retirement is already set in place so i do what i need to do as far as um maintaining a certain lifestyle but also i have i also enjoy what i do i'm not under as much stress as i used to be mm i'm not well i'm not totally outgoing but um i'm not i'm not extremely shy i'm probably right in the middle maybe more towards outgoing but i'm not totally outgoing i mean when i'm around other people i am uh in a social situation i i guess you could consider me an outgoing person but um obviously i do have my own little uh private issues that i keep to myself oh sure you know i have um uh couple years ago i had a heart attack and i had to have bypass operation and it had to yeah it had to do with stress and things like that i don't talk about that much other than those around me that are close to me um if i meet someone new i don't just openly say well you know i've experienced this this and this so i just basically um if it comes up i won't deny it or if it comes up and if it's if it i feel like it's something to talk about i will talk about it actually um my relaxation is um i'm currently um living with my mom my mother and uh she's a senior citizen and she's alone um so what i do for uh relaxation or to relieve stress is i actually help <he> help her do yard work take care of all the gardening and things like that and that's actually very uh therapeutic you know um i'm not um i'm not a short-fused kinda person it takes a lot to get me really angry so as far as um my temper's concerned there's not there's not much to that um i'm trying to think here <sigh> i can't recall when the last time it was but it was probably last year sometime when i um had a creditor that i was dealing with um being very difficult to work with um and i owed money as far as um some medical expenses that were incurred when i had my heart attack a few years ago and uh they weren't very understanding of the situation and i uh i really got a little upset about that because um i felt like i was being honest with them and i was i was more than willing to take care of my issues but uh they were playing hardball and i didn't care for that it does <laughter> probably the hardest xxx decision i ever had to make was um it had to do with a life and death situation with my my stepfather who was battling uh prostate cancer and yeah uh making a decision with my mother whether to proceed with a procedure that was gonna either um help him or there was a slight chance it was gonna help him even though he was pretty terminal at that point or it would it would kill him you know um and that was really tough it was really tough decision to make but uh uh you know i i felt like if i didn't try and see if we could save his life <l> help save his life or if it we didn't take a chance and and take that extra step that i would regret it in the long run it is it was um well right now um i'm separated from my wife so uh she has her issues i have my issues but we are not divorced we're just separated and um we still have a relationship where we still speak to each other we just don't live together and the relationship with my mother's really great you know um she's very understanding i'm an only child so she likes having me around which is good because she's in her late she's in her later stage of her life she's eighty two years old and and so she needs to uh i guess it's good that in in in it's own way maybe fate has taken place because you know eh someone eighty two years old by themselves in a huge house is not a good thing but with me there i think she feels <fe> there's a comfort level she feels with me there especially being her only child probably the most guilty i feel about anything are are the things that i did to hurt my marriage um as far as um the things that i did the selfish things that i did when i was much younger that um obviously affected the relationship between myself and my wife uh yeah i um got caught up in a situation where um i was working tremendous amounts of hours under a lotta stress my wife was also working a lotta hours in a job that she had and uh we were growing apart and um when she was away my form of release was to go uh to the casinos and gamble and so you know i spent a lot of time in in the casinos and what eventually happened was i spent a lot of money and obviously that was a major issue regarding our relationship had to do with trust because um it it was devastating to my wife i felt uh when <whe> when it when it came to light um i felt very guilty and i felt less than a human being at that point in my life no not at all no not really no i don't have problems sleeping that's i i don't ever recall having any problem sleeping so no no not at all no uh i well i just <deep breath> the only thing i could say is um after i had my heart attack a few years ago um i don't let i find myself not letting the small details or small things in life bother me as much as they did before so i tend to be a little bit more easygoing and my friends and family have noticed that the last time i felt really happy um probably when i had a visit with my cardiologist after my heart attack and um he basically said to me that after many tests and many uh months of uh rehabilitation that he was happy to explain to me that there was no scar tissue no major scar tissue that had occurred with my heart because of my heart heart attack and that um i could count on living a pretty much normal life as long as i watched my diet and took my medications well i guess number one thing is uh my physical being itself i like to be a little bit more healthier lose some more weight um just in general just be more healthier physically and as far as mentally um just not go back to those ways of thinking where i was doing the wrong things instead of the right things and not to be so selfish just one day at a time you know i just uh try to be at peace with my myself and try to have some peace of mind on a daily basis i meditate i read you know i read some books i watch t_v i i do things that i know that um if i can i if i can help myself i do things to help myself well there's a lot that i regret obviously in my marriage uh my uh working career as far as i had a long career with this majors uh food chain and and i basically because of my gambling issues i ended up ruining a a very good career but um at this point right now there's not much i can do i can't change what's been done so i don't focus too much on the past i just look at what's in front of me and just focus on what's in front of me eh every day what advice <laughter> wake up and see <s> and see what you're doing to yourself and you know make the changes that need to be changed um you know <kno> uh you know i'm not a uh i'm not someone that's not intelligent but i was intelligent enough to know what's right from wrong and um scrubbed_entry you're what you're doing is wrong you need to change your behavior immediately probably the proud <pro> what i'm proud about overall is the fact that um i did all these awful things but deep down i don't think as a person i'm a bad person i have to remember that um when i was caught up in all the gambling and compulsive behavior it was because i had an illness a compulsive uh obsessive compulsive behavior that made me ill and um that i was a sick person just trying to become healthy and every day that's what my life is about it's about recovery and uh just making sure that uh i do the right things from the time i wake up in the morning to the time i go to sleep at night one day at a time it's not as hard as you think it's but it is a process where you need to be diligent about your behavior and your routines and um just know that what's not right for you you know it could be okay for other people to do certain things but i cannot do those things anymore um most of my best friends can uh describe me as probably easygoing generous um a nice person to be around and um you know they were obviously a little shocked when they found out of all my issues uh related to the gambling and the my and the break-up of break-up of my marriage which you know it's still not over yet you know well my ideal weekend starts off usually um after i have breakfast with my mother early in the morning like around six o'clock um i go to a local park and uh it's about this park is probably laid out where you can walk up a hill and down a hill it's about three and a half miles and i take a brisk walk in the morning um get my blood flowing and get my heart rate going and then after that i um you know go home um work in the yard a few hours take a shower and relax and then just uh kinda kick back for the rest of the day and then the the the next day i i do the same thing again in the morning i go for a walk work out in the yard watch t_v whatever just relax that's how a weekend goes for me and thank you bye,0
364,<synch> i am i feel pretty good i'm wide awake i had an good breakfast and a nice cup of coffee and uh i have an easy day today so i am just gonna chat with you then i'm going to the gym and run some errands so i plan on having a nice day today i was born and raised in los angeles and i'm one of the few locals from around here and uh i went to school away and uh but i'm one of the few natives that are actually in los angeles yes i am i like the weather having owned a vacation house in another state that i found to be too hot and humid in florida i love the weather here um i like the culture i like the diversity i like the familiarity i like that beaches uh but i also like that just an hour and a half away one can go to the desert say palm springs palm desert but also another hour and a half two hours away you can go to arrowhead or big bear and go snowboarding or skiing or things like that and uh i think it's a great place to live thank you well more of some maybe some of the things i don't like about l_a or say california in general say like the high tax rate which the state tax rate is up to thirteen point something now which is gonna chase business out of here also the regulations i'm a small business owner so all the regulations are clearly affecting business so many of my peers have moved their businesses to texas arizona nevada etcetera some of the other western states that are less regulated and uh that's a big problem here in uh uh california it really does most people don't understand it but  it's uh also uh you know besides the high taxes you know there's a big immigration problem which being born and raised here most people don't see that but it's a big tax on the social service system and that's what makes our taxes uh so high until they really secure the borders and get that taken care of so that's you know but people don't seem to want to really deal with uh deal with that but it clearly affects businesses because from all the other things that's why our taxes are so high and people are moving out of state i enjoy traveling i've been to sixty six countries and uh i don't travel as much as i used to but i've traveled quite a bit and i've learned a couple of languages and uh i served i'm sorry uh i didn't really understand uh your question when you said like what i don't think you understood what i said but i'll just go back and i've been all through europe eastern europe asia south america north africa um and i enjoy that and enjoy warm climates now especially where you can go and relax and there's warm water to surf 'cause the cold water kind of makes my back stiffen up and i also like to exercise and surf and do yoga and work out and uh i try to eat healthy and uh that's a big part of my life oh sure um one of my favorite trips of all time was i used to when i was younger see how many countries i could do in a relatively short period of time say in a three or four week span but about ten years ago we actually went to paris and stayed for about a week and really got to know the city even though i'd been there about ten times we got to know the city really well which was great really lived like a local and rented a small flat and cooked and did our own shopping but really having been there so many times i really never stayed for more than three or four days it was fun to stay there for about you know almost a month and uh really get to learn the city and it was fun even though i grew up in l_a i grew up taking french which there wasn't a big spanish speaking population when i when i was younger my mother insisted that all of us kids take french even though spanish would've been a lot more valuable but i took french uh all through uh elementary junior high and uh high school so it was nice to practice my french even though i don't remember a whole lot and even though i stopped speaking french with the french you know and my accent is not the greatest so after a couple sentences they start talking english to me <laughter> so that was a uh i have a few different degrees so uh i was a naval science major as an undergraduate and uh that was fun and i also have a masters uh degree in economics and i have a degree in crisis management so uh i found them um interesting and uh it was something that i wanted to do where i went to college i went to the naval academy i went there to play sports and  i found it real interesting being from southern california going to school in maryland and i originally wanted to be a doctor but once you start going to school for a little bit you change your mind etcetera so um i'm actually in the wholesale business now for wholesale distributors of furniture products and it was a family business but i went to work there a number of years ago well you know my grandfather and recently father passed away so i sort of run a eighty year old family business and it's pretty interesting i like it having grown up around it but it's different than other jobs i've had in the past hm actually probably my dream job i think cooking and staying at home this fun i've changed so much i enjoy cooking and staying at home and uh uh i would probably like to stay home and raise kids because i do have one daughter and uh you know didn't get to spend as much time with her when she was younger as i would've liked but i think i would be better than say a lot of women i know  that want to work i actually like cooking and hanging around the house and taking care of kids you know that i like doing i'm always on a part time basis but do that having pretty much worked most of my life it seems like boy that would be fun to stay home and uh do that having pretty much worked most of my life so probably never happen but it sounds something that to me would be fun uh i think i'm um generally more reserved and shy with strangers but when i get to know someone or feel comfortable i think i'm more of an extrovert whereas most strangers might think i'm more introverted but i think i'm when i feel comfortable with certain people and i don't know what it is i can meet a stranger and  be totally confident or people that i might've known for years either from a personal or a business situation and be more um introverted i mean i just i just go with the dynamics but i think my outward manifestation is to be a little more shy in general and reserved <reser> i use like to use the term reserved oh wow that's a great idea i used to have that on uh one of my i have uh several computers at home and that used to be one of my screensavers uh as well i usually tend when when i need to relax or had a stressful day or stressful personal events or going for a long walk or going for a long walk or going for a long walk i usually find exercise whether it be yoga or going for a long walk or going to the gym or going for a run or going to the beach you know maybe going surfing when the weather's warm i don't surf in cold weather anymore because it makes it gives me like a brain freeze even though i've surfed for you know over thirty years i had it uh i usually find exercise helps me relax the best or sometimes just vegging out on the couch in front of the t_v i find very relaxing <laughter> but i like that screensaver i used to have that on one of my uh screensavers at home but yes that was uh that was it but that's one of the things that took me a number of years to master though were my relaxation skills i probably didn't have them the best in my twenties but over the years i think i've gotten better uh at the i think that's a key thing and i think as we mature as we learn how to do that i wish i'd learned how to do that and be a little more how do you had had the skills earlier i like to think i'm pretty good i think i'm a lot better as well as that as i've aged um you know i i am more likely to think before i speak now whereas say twenty years ago i was more likely to act before i fought so i might've said more things that i in a whatever tense situation whether it be personal or a work situation um but i've never had a a a violent temper but i would have a temper where i fly off the handle instead of taking a deep breath and reflecting on it i think i'm a lot better at that  now than i was say in my teens or twenties so when i think a lot of that comes i think the keyword there is maturity oh wow you know i haven't really had an argument with anybody in several years <y> what i would consider a traditional argument um probably um my ex wife a number of years ago wehad an argument basically just over my daughter and it wasn't anything violent but it was heated just basically one of the reasons we didn't weren't married our values were so different just our ideas of parenting and uh just uh outlook on life was so different i think that caused us to butt heads but it was just i don't know if i'd call it an argument but it was more of just a uh one of those let's agree to disagree butt heads so i felt like i was talking to a wall and i actually felt more mad at myself that i should've learned earlier in life that boy that before you get married to someone have children with them that's the kind of discussions that people should usually have but you're not really thinking of that because sometimes when we're younger we're looking at boy how does that i look great on paper to her and she looked great on paper to me but you know i'm pretty easy going and i have different ideas on raising children how she did and that was more not that she was wrong and i was right not that i was right and she was wrong it was just how we were raised and our just different views and we never really discussed those things but it was really just fundamental reasons why we butted heads and more weren't really a good match whereas other things looked good you know on paper to both of us hm there's one recently my father passed away uh recently thank you and really because in our religion you know you plan a funeral very quickly you know typically within a couple of days and i really only invited very very close friends and family members i was more or less in charge of it my dad was remarried but his widow was sort of not really up to it so i took care of it and i wish i had invited a i kept it very private and really just told people after the fact that he knew that would've liked to have come tp the service had they known about it so i really only invited because just the time pressure really just a handful of people but now as time's passed i wish i'd invited more of his friends instead of just two or three close friends you know ten or twenty acquaintances and people he knew from business or over the years and i really just and even distant family members i really just told after the fact i really didn't invite them because i was under a time pressure but i could've easily done it via email or it's hard to call everybody personally but i wish that's something 'cause people have expressed a little they were upset with me when my other family members threw it all back at me oh you didn't tell me 'til after the fact that you know so and so had passed so they all threw it at me because i was more or less doing it so i wish i i did that differently but i did the best i could at the time so i'm not really mad at myself about something i probably should've been more prepared for also something <s s something> that was coming was inevitable so um well both my parents are recently uh deceased in the last couple of years and i had a brother that i have three younger brothers one of who passed away in december and we're not super close like i always like i look at other families we were just never like that norman rockwell uh painting i guess we're also uh different and uh i have a close relationship with friends and a more distant relationship with family not that it's strange but i wish it was more like boy one of those families that got together every sunday and had dinner and all that we just never did that because we're all all so uh uh different yeah it's yeah just being that's how it is but you know to strangers and most people i just say you know howdy the family everybody's great you know but i think every family has their own sort of stuff um no but i thought probably i could've had it before from some other events in my life and i just wasn't sure i've had been to some therapy in the past just from you know uh i was in the military and i was never really sure if that that's exactly what it was but i think i function pretty well but i just wasn't sure that i had been to some therapy and counseling over the years i didn't enlist i was an officer i went to one of the service academies that um seventeen i started when after high school and i went to a service academy so it's more prestige it just isn't enlisting it's the hard where i went it's the hardest school in america to get into i was but same age as everybody else that went there uh we did nineteen eighty three um just basically wasn't anything intense it was just we were just around some we were just we weren't allowed to carry ammunition we were just our position were just shelled at the time and poison gas was sprayed on us so that was a it wasn't it wasn't anything too uh too intense it was a lot you know because it the service i was in the training was way more intense than any actual combat situation that's because they train you well it's like you practice harder than you play if you're an athlete if you play football you practice harder than you you actually play in the game and the same with uh you know if you're in a combat unit well it made me more patriotic having grown up in california whereas people who are from all over the country and i got to meet whereas most of say my friends who grew up in affluent los angeles like i did never really went out and met a lot of americans and people from different backgrounds and i ended up becoming uh just more patriotic and a deeper sense of pride in the country whereas you really don't grow up with that in southern california whereas someone in texas or kentucky or tennessee or georgia north dakota south dakota montana grows up with that kind of uh pride so i thought it was good and it unlike so many of my friends that they don't know any there's any life between malibu and manhattan uh i went to graduate i was still in the reserves but i went to graduate school and i got two graduate degrees and i went to work in private enterprise uh didn't care for it then i joined the fire department i was a fire fighter and paramedic for a number of years and then after i got divorced it was harder to do the custody situation with my daughter so i went to work in a family business and that's pretty much my career in a nutshell um at first it was because i had such a bearing in my butt from the way i walked i talked and again i was an officer uh you were very regimented on the way you dressed in your private time it was harder took me awhile to be able to come back to los angeles uh because it was just so uh so different i think i handled it better than most i have a stronger personality so but it was a great experience um it all depends if i exercise regularly and i don't eat too late and things are going well in my life i generally sleep pretty well even though i might have to get up and go to the bathroom once during the night um but i generally sleep uh i generally sleep pretty well i feel pretty good lately you know i've been like anybody else more periods of blue in your life but boy the last few months i feel great pretty much no not really i seem i think i seem a little happier more content lately um i've had thought maybe in the past because i do have a family history of it and you know it wasn't anything real too debilitating and i wasn't able to really function on my own but i was concerned with it and sought counseling i do i was really against it in the past and until after i went i mean i wish i went more say during my uh my marriage over the course of uh my life now i think it's very useful however in the past i was one of those i grew up hearing that it was just ridiculous and it was a waste of money etcetera but i think it's a useful tool if you're open to it oh just some questions i wanted just an honest opinion outside of friends or strangers from a professional you know about life relationships and sometimes it's good talking things out with a a professional even though i wouldn't see someone like you in real life i prefer someone who's older than i am a little more life experience than someone who's maybe younger so but yeah i think it's a useful tool and i really did a hundred and eighty degree switch on that uh i don't go now i'm sorta taking a break from it but i'm not against it if i have some issues i wanna bounce off i do have someone that i go to yeah i think it's nice you know they really if you go to someone who's good and again i've been to a few different people and sort of therapist shopped they really don't tell you what to think which i think is great you know that's always in the past they just help you talk through your your thoughts and your feelings and let you decide for yourself but bring a little clarity to the situation that's why i like talking to someone who has a lot more life experience and i generally feel more comfortable talking to a woman about that stuff than say to a man so but it's um i think it's a a useful tool i got some good ideas and was able to it's nice balancing some things off totally someone who's unbiased and not in your day to day life instead of talking to a a romantic partner or a close friend who knows you but sometimes bouncing the people off of strangers is good uh this morning i know this this is weird but i'm clearly someone and i'd say this as a joke to my friends and family and associates i clearly have i'm having an easy day today 'cause i knew we're having nice weather and i have a bunch of errands to run and i clearly have seasonal affective disorder but i woke up so happy today when i know it's gonna be eighty degrees out and when the weather's nice i'm generally a lot more happier than when the weather's [laughter] dark and blue and rainy and cold where i always i know that term so but i'm just well i woke up really happy today because i knew it's gonna be a nice day and i looked forward to feeling the sun so uh most of my friends i'm sort of a renaissance man i know a little bit about a lot of subjects i'm too smart for my own good and i'm a i know a a lot a lot of permeable things i'm pretty rational i'm very resourceful people always call me when they have issues and i help talk them through it or i'm resourceful and tell them where to go whether it's where to buy a new computer or buy a new car or you know i'm great with medical diagnoses uh and uh you know people also say i'm a lot of fun i'm fun to be with and um i also have i don't have a lot of grey areas people will either really like me or don't like me with me things are pretty much black and white i am what i am i don't b_s you know i'm the opposite of a politician so i don't tell people what they want to hear i don't be rude not rude to anybody but i pretty much call things as i see them so that's pretty much no not really 'cause i do everything tactfully i like to think i do uh probably just i probably spent more time with my parents before they passed but i was busy uh i probably wish i was able to spend more time with my daughter when she was younger uh but just a lot of it's very typical really to think things through a little bit more be a little less impulsive or have pretended to be more impulsive when i was younger than i am now i think that's that's it and i would look at things in the long term instead of looking in things in the short term you know when you make decisions or choices um i'm proud of my daughter she's a nice young lady i am uh proud of my public service i've never done a job really for money of my military service and fire service um there are very few people like me who did it who are as had the background in education that i did but i like public service and um so i'm proud of uh that  proud of all the certificates i have hanging on my walls at home and degrees sort of like trophies i'm proud that i've been able to stay in good physical shape over the years and knock wood maintain good health it was nice meeting you bye bye thank you,0
366,<synch> yeah i'm great and you uh los angeles california uh <sigh> i like the diversity i feel l_a by itself is a country there's so much to do so much to explore and uh there's nothing like it traffic <laughter> uh i would say traffic and the real estate prices are kinda crazy compared to the rest of the country but other than that then you know it's fine i have traveled um i have traveled a bit um i would like to travel more though so but i've traveled to i've been to a few countries um i've been to i won't say europe that's a continent um i've been to uh london <deep breath> um i was born here but my family's from nigeria so i've been to nigeria a few times i've been to denmark um amsterdam i've been to uh where else have i gone uh germany um and i think that's i think that's it yeah think that's it yeah just exploring uh exploring <exp> exploring new places um seeing new things meeting new people a different culture it's definitely um um gives you an appreciation for life and the diversity of it and also um going to countries that may not be as developed as the u_s it definitely it definitely gives you a greater appreciation of you know this country yeah okay well <sigh> uh let's see london i accident actually when i first heard about going to london i really didn't care for it 'cause i didn't know much about it the only i thing i remember <mem> i remember is watching mary poppins <laughter> and um but um when i went there i absolutely fell in love with it um just <deep breath> it still <sti> it has the hustle and bustle of l_a but at the same time you can go at a very very slow pace um we didn't do any driving we just went on the tube um which is their like the underground subway station which i absolutely fell in love with and um just exploring um different parts of the city we went to you know big ben westminster abbey uh they actually had when i went there they had the premiere of um what movie was this um slumdog millionaire and also they had the premiere for um seven seven pounds it was a movie with will smith um they did so will smith was over there and we were you know me and my friends were like kinda like screaming like we were like groupies <laughter> just you know just <laughter> just <laughter> just to you know for antics but um yeah it was it was a lot of fun it was a lot of fun yeah uh business management and an option in human resources management what that means i have no idea <laughter> um good question i've always i've always wanted to go into business um and i've always wanted to study finance but i didn't think i would learn too much about finance from college per se i think i've learned more in the real world whatnot so the other option was human resource and i'm always fascinated about you know relationships and people always like reading articles about that stuff so i went for that no <laughter> well i still i still kinda use what i've learned but i i work in property management so um it still has to do with people anything to do with people i'm fascinated about so yeah <laughter> that was a good one um my dream job wow i would say being a life coach i would uh yeah i would say that would my dream job because i love helping people become successes and i help i love being a part of someone else's success even no regardless of how small it is um whether it be words of encouragement or helping somebody figure out a situation i like um i just help <hel> like helping people have a better life so i think uh you know but i do it for free i'd do it for free like all day yeah yeah more outgoing definitely more outgoing i'm usually um the life well it's it's weird 'cause i'm usually considered like the life of the party i'm the one who's cracking jokes and making everybody laugh at the same time i can be very very quiet and to myself so yeah <laughter> right <sigh> to relax i usually listen to music i usually listen to music to relax me or i pray to to relax myself or listen to some really calm music so yeah very good very very good i used to uh i wouldn't say it was a bad temper but i was known to um go off quote on quote <laughter> not in a not in a you know not throwing chairs or anything like that but i'm a very very patient person but once that patience <patien> is gone and for you to do that you have to really really really really push my buttons for a long time and once it's done i i just go off no mm mm no <sigh> the last time i argued with someone <some> wow i haven't argued with somebody in a long time um <sigh> boy mm uh i argued with my no i would say my i think it my dad i argued with him um about <sigh> xxx what was it about um we were disagreeing on some things about when we were gonna supposed to go back to nigeria and he wasn't listening to it was a kind of like a group discussion myself and my my siblings and he was being very subjective he wasn't being open to other people's suggestions and suggestions and concerns so um it started an argument uh very uh i wouldn't say angry per se but i felt very kinda like i was losing control like um i'm the type where i i like to be in control of my emotions and of my thoughts and i feel once that patience is gone and i start going off it's kinda like this this uh you know i won't call it a blur but i'm very witty and quick with what i say so i will instantly say something that you know up not necessarily hurtful but um very direct and to the point and i make sure i get my point across yeah um i have three brothers one one younger two older i'm very close with my family and my mom is one of my best friends um <sigh> my brothers are great um love 'em to death uh my father eh he's moreso out of the picture yeah <deep breath> hmm <sigh> i don't i don't really i'm not the guilty type <laughter> i don't feel guilty i'm not one to shy away from what i've done and i definitely own up to what i do i'm not one to shy away from responsibility but i don't think i ever feel guilty for anything i do yeah i don't think i feel i i usually don't feel guilty yeah <deep breath> pretty pretty easy um pretty easy at <a> at yeah i'm pretty good at falling asleep except when i'm excited and when i'm reading <laughter> when i'm trying to when i'm when i'm focused on learning something like i'll read and read and read even when it's past my bed time but now i'm trying to work on waking up much earlier then when i am now and that's kind of a struggle <st> a little bit of a struggle but i'm getting to it so good um i've been feeling i've been feeling fine you know i'm generally i have a very very happy disposition and so no uh you know deep depressing moods nothing like that and whenever if i feel do feel like i'm going i don't allow myself to go to that place nah no sorry <sigh> mm <sigh> thoughts i would say well <we> it's i wouldn't say necessarily changes but i'd say moreso behaviors learning how to let go of past decisions maybe and kinda how they they played their course in my life um i just sometimes i kinda look back and say what if i did this what would've how would life be now no so the those are some games i play but other than that that's it hmm <laughter> regret uh no no mm mm there isn't anything i regret <sigh> ten to twenty years ago i would say don't be afraid of who you are um be authentic um more importantly with yourself hmm erase from my memory uh boy that's a good one <sigh> hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm uh wow erase from my memory uh i would say when i told <t> when i told my dad that he should act like a father maybe i shouldn't yeah there was um that was actually one of the times i <laughter> another time i went off usually with him um uh basically i had decided not to go to a private um not to go away for college um so <s> i went <we> i decided to stay local so i can look after my little brother and um <sigh> my senior year i was overloading with everything i had maybe like uh four a_p classes i was working at i was working three jobs at the time and i was also in track and field so needless to say i was <laughter> i i i i was kinda like burning myself i was kinda like burning myself out and um i wasn't doing well in a_p calculus because i decided to go to a j_c first and transfer also to save money for college too and when i told him you know the teacher called saying i was falling asleep in class um just because mind you after school i'd work an eight hour shift 'cause i was a retail manager at the time so um and i'd come home after that shift to do homework mm calculus let alone um so uh um he would get upset and i told him i spoke with my counselor i already told him that i don't need that class to go to the j_c isn't something that i continue with so i'm just gonna i can't drop out at that point in time so i'm just gonna you know you know just just take the d or fail whatever and he didn't he didn't like that 'cause he is a teacher <laughter> i think maybe that's what maybe where it came from he's a teacher as well um and so he started blaming like my jobs and wanting to call my boss and it was it was just too much and i told him you know since you're my father you should act like it but i was it was a more aggressive <laughter> way i said it so that was um one thing oh i actually i do i i do remember i do regret one thing um and that is i wish i continued um with college throughout like i i burnt myself out um i was spreading myself too thin there was actually i was actually on track to graduate from college at i wanna say nineteen 'cause i started taking college classes in high school starting sophomore year in high school but i with that that stuff and the stuff with my dad and working i just kinda like stopped going to school for a while and just worked but i went back to finish so but i wish i just would've continued maybe that's one small thing but that's something small though yeah hmm i'm very um i'm a very compassionate and understanding person um i like learning new things um i'm a very very happy person people come to me for advice i'm very objective i'll tell you the good the bad the ugly and um yeah those are some of my best qualities yeah and i'm fun i like to have fun i'll have fun in any situation i can make light of any situation like i'm the kinda type <ty> type of person i can break the tension in the room that's sort of that sort of uh <tisk> um personality trait yeah wish i was taller <laughter> um uh besides my height hmm i wish ah maybe i don't know if it's uh be more i won't say be more in touch with my emotions but i think i would say understanding people's how people feel about me in their shoes i think that would be one thing because i'm the type of person where people say that they love me or care about me and i'm like okay great thank you i appreciate that but i don't realize how much they do i think that's a realizing how much they care and love me that's one thing i would like to get more of a grasp on <laughter> my best friend <deep breath> uh she describes me as someone who's funny crazy um objective um loyal um ambitious hardworking um mean <laughter> when i just make jokes she says you're so mean but um just <sigh> i just i <laughter> i i just like to i joke around all the time and so um we were right now we're actually planning um uh a friend of mine or a friend of ours um a baby shower i'm giving her some ideas and there's another friend who was invited who we had some issues in the past and someone i don't talk to or hang out with we used to be really close but i don't really talk to that person but i don't mind them being there so she also talked about having <havi> celebrating her birthday also at kinda like after the baby shower and there is another friend whose birthday was before the baby shower who we really <rea> didn't do anything for and i'm like well if we're celebrating this person's birthday might as well we should definitely you know honor this person's birthday as well since we're closer to you know the person xxx birthday's passed and i said you know what just why <wh> don't we celebrate everybody's birthday <laughter> forget the baby shower just do the birthdays and then <laughter> that's when that's when she said you're so mean <laughter> but she was laughing about it so yeah yeah uh <sigh> most proud of in my in my life <deep breath> uh <sigh> i would say being there for my family being being a a mentally and emotionally strong person family's gone through a lot of challenges and a lotta times i've been the one to make sure everything goes okay and everything make sure <su> everything <everythi> make sure everything goes accordingly um so i'd say more than anything making sure i was there for my family yeah oh okay thank you bye have a good one,0
367,<sync> yes i'm okay um i'm a little pensive i guess a little uh down but more or less okay i was born in annapolis maryland on the east coast originally i moved because i went to film school um and but then i decided to come i moved to washington d_c to do some work and now i'm back here again it's very different um being from the east coast it just has a different feel to it um but living l_a is very has a very different kind of um attitude i guess and so it's a little difficult but i but i've gotten more used to it since i've been here uh not at all um when i left things got things were sort of i i lost my job out there and so i had to move out here kind of quick to um to be with uh some people who were gonna help me out and i'm just sort of i don't know if estranged is the right word but i'm just kind of not really speaking to my family or old friends that often it's not easy it's it's kind of um i miss i miss a lot of people i miss my old life before i lost my job um i miss um some friends um i miss a lot of the relationships that i had out there um so it's difficult i mean it weighs on my mind a lot um i feel like i failed and now i'm here and i can't seem to get back on my feet so it's it's it's hard depends on the situation i think i'm outgoing when i'm comfortable um and then i'm extremely outgoing but when i'm in a situation i'm not comfortable with i tend to be a lot more shy so that doesn't really answer your question but um [clears throat] i have certain i do i do a lot of writing um i have certain music that i listen to as i'm writing and when i can when i can get really into that and sort of shut out the rest of the world um the music and the the thoughts just kind of happening really um it can it soothes me it's like it's when i feel most relaxed i guess um a few weeks ago i guess i was i'd been working on a book on a on a on a novel and when i was really when i was really getting into writing it and um it was really working for me that was that was good that was really good i felt like i was accomplishing something and i felt really relaxed um it was about a guy who is searching for something it's it's uh it's his last day on earth and so he's going to find a person that he that he met and just was so struck by that he needs to he needs to find her and spend the last few minutes that he has on earth with her just because sort of uh it's sort of romantic adventure comedy kind of thing well i've always i've always been a writer part of the reason i came to l_a was because of screenwriting um so i wrote some screenplays and uh you know had a little success with that out here and but since since then i've kind of gotten tired of the limitations of the screenwriting and i've started to write more short stories and and longer just creative writing so i i've been meaning to write a novel but i was just waiting for the idea to to really hit me it's not easy the [exhale] the parts the parts when it's good it's really good but getting there is sometimes a real struggle um i find it difficult i have a real love hate relationship with writing when i when i love it i just absolutely love it but sometimes i hate it because it's so difficult um but it's worth it for the times when it's when it's good good i don't i don't really have a temper i it's not i mean most of my anger that i have is directed inward as opposed to outward to other people um if something is really really stressful or if i'm in a situation like a very intense confrontation i can lose it but i probably <prob> that's probably only happened to me three four times in my whole life i mean generally i pretty much try to it when i'm upset i i get upset with myself not with other people um last night i guess well <weh> um i got in an argument about whether or not cleaning vegetables was necessary because of i forget it but it well no it was about whether you can clean vegetables after you cut them because i'd already started cutting the vegetables and i thought that would be okay so it turned into this big argument and we did google searches to figure out who was right and who was wrong and i i ended up being wrong on that one but it is yeah that was it wasn't a blow up argument but it was a definite argument um uh a lot so much um uh i i i was in uh a relationship that i really really um that i really wanted to work and uh i ended up and it was partly due to i hadn't i was on i wasn't on the right medication and so i was going at like everything sort of spiraled out of control and i feel really guilty about the way that that ended and i mean i wasn't i wasn't mean but i was but i was getting more and more messed up and i couldn't stop it and it ended and so i feel really guilty about not doing enough and and not and and you know making her have to tell me that she never wanted to see me again so that was pretty that was pretty tough well some of it was was that i wasn't medicated properly i mean now i've been to a doctor and i'm on medication that's completely kind of i mean i still get i still get upset and i still get depressed but it's not like it was it's not i don't completely lose it for days at a time um so i mean i know there's a part of me that knows logically that it wasn't all my fault and that if i had if i had been able to deal with the chemicals in my brain then i would've then it would've probably be different if i was who i am now then i would've i would i would be i would be it probably would have gone very differently or maybe it wouldn't have but i mean i could have i don't know i don't know if i could've done anything different things being how they were i mean it's it's possible uh i mean obviously yeah because i mean that's what i do i i take little things <thin> i mean i take little things and i just think about them all the time in my head until until it drives me crazy i dwell on stuff um and it's like any little detail that comes up i suddenly remember and it can just throw me off for a whole day i mean i still i still get i still get really uncomfortable and embarassed and then feel ashamed about stuff that i did in high school which was years and years ago which i shouldn't even be thinking about anymore 'cause it's so in the past but i still get that feeling like i'm right back there well it's it's not easy i've been trying to figure out ways to deal with it i i mean i dealt with it for a long time by by by drinking and and you know just trying to like slow my mind down that way um but you know since the medication it's been better it hasn't been impossible to deal with it hasn't been easy but it's but it's been better um well like i said i do a lot of you know if i'm if i'm writing or if i'm doing anything like i kind of have to almost be doing two things at once to occupy my brain completely um if i'm watching t_v i have to be playing a game on my phone if i'm using i'm the computer i have to be you know watching a t_v show or a movie on you know on in another window so that i can just keep my mind occupied during all of that um i just need i mean i i wish that i could just sort of let the thoughts come and deal with them but i just i can't yet they're triggered by everything pretty much anything that i that i see if i if i if i hear somebody with a dutch last name if i if i hear somebody talk about wisconsin if i hear you know people talk about just anything you know i can reach back and connect to to this it's really it's really i don't know that's the thing i mean i don't ever get a break from it yeah um i don't know i'm a very light sleeper so i awake and asleep and awake and asleep <asl> i have no problem going back to sleep but i generally you know don't i don't know i never really needed much sleep so it's just only recently that i've really started to to like feel the effects of not getting enough sleep like i would i would usually stay up until two or three in the morning so that i could just be so exhausted that i could just conk out and wake up the next day and feel fine go to work um but now it's it's it's like if i do that i can't i still don't get enough sleep i don't conk out i still just sleep very lightly you know i get up i toss and turn all night you know and now it's just it's yeah i don't sleep too great right now um pretty i mean i don't know it's hard to it's hard to know i i usually just kind of power through it and just i'm uh i'm like how i am now just i just feel bad um i think about three three four years ago um it was when i i had been given taking stuff for anxiety for for years before that but then i finally got a psychiatrist who actually sat down and talked to me and said you've actually got this situation and we need to get you on the medication that you're on is not working you need to get on this new medication that will actually start to like even you out and heal you a little bit from all this so so yeah that was that was kind of a a turning point but unfortunately it happened after everything uh went bad so i don't know in the moment i don't know i don't really think i thought about it too much then but looking back on it i feel it really makes me angry it really makes me you know given where i am right now it makes me really angry that i'm that i had to that i i lost everything because because of chemicals in my brain because of things that i couldn't control and that you know the people that were supposed to help me weren't helping me i mean i was paying i was paying a lot of money to to go see doctors and they were doing and they you know it wasn't it was it didn't help it didn't work until until you know i managed to find somebody who did work and i just yeah so i'm i'm like thanks guys for helping but it was a little it's a little late now um there really wasn't any choice i had to i was i was a mess i was it was either i was i was self medicating it was affecting my work i mean it was everything was just at there was a point where i really realized that i mean i just had to like make this different but again it was too late because you know then my review came up a few months later and you know after after everything after being institutionalized once or twice and all this stuff you know they just decided that i was just not worth keeping around so they laid me off but it was at least that and not firing me but but but yeah but so i got help but it was but it wasn't soon enough uh not not as much as i should um i go to a couple of meetings i go to i go to a_a so that i can um you know keep control of that aspect too <t> too and there's a there's a therapy aspect to that um unfortunately you know being unemployed my unemployment ran out you know i'm i'm you know i'm getting my medication from the city of l_a so you know i'm not really in a position to put money into seeing somebody so i have a psychiatrist that i go see but it's really very i've i've only seen her three times in the past year so it's basically to keep my medication coming and then there's you <laughter> right well like i said i mean just the talk <tah> i mean the the let's just take the a_a for example because that's probably the closest <cloth> closest for that i'm seeing with therapy for now um just saying stuff outloud is just like getting getting this stuff out trying to figure out how to take that mess that's in your stomach and in your brain and make it into words and sentences that make sense that you can actually deal with is a big step like regardless of who you're saying it to whether it's a therapist or just a room full of of drunks you know i mean you're you're taking all that stuff that's that's really been killing you and you're making it into something you can deal with something that you can write down something that you can talk about as opposed to just letting it just sit there as this formless thing yeah um you know better than i than i have been um i mean it it sort of it goes <g> it has its ups and downs um you know i'm applying for jobs five six jobs or more a a day you know and never getting a response never getting an interview never even getting close to to to being self sufficient again um it's hard but that's like real world problems i feel like the chemical parts are getting under control like the the depression is getting under control so now it's just i have to deal with real life which is it just has its it's just its own own challenge yeah um it was probably you know a couple years ago um i i was i mean the thing that immediately comes to mind uh is everything was going well at my job i was making these great videos with with this person that i that iwas having a relationship with and we were really close we were having fun together and we went out and got a christmas tree and we spent the all this time picking out the perfect christmas tree and it was just feeling like a part of somebody's life and feeling like a part of the bigger the bigger life that's that's out there you know like what normal people feel you know for that instant i felt like a normal person doing a normal thing with a pretty girl who he really really liked a lot and you know everything was going really well and i mean it wasn't going really well because it was all messed up but for that instant i felt like a normal person a normal happy person and part of what makes it so hard now is knowing that i don't know if i'll ever feel that again so um probably the probably this educational <educary> educational series i did uh an educational uh video series i did for the national science foundation um it was it it was really hard and it but in the end it turned out really good and you know i'm hoping that it helps a lot of kids and it helps the world with getting kids excited about science and about um and about the world around them so that i feel like that was a real contribution that i made to the world oh it was part of you know it was part of my my job um it was it was a we were trying to come up with with new ideas uh for because we would put together videos and stuff to give you know to to schools and everything and they had done those before but we decided to do something really big you know and there was a lot of traveling and there was a lot of um and there was a lot to it and so it was probably the biggest project that the n_s_f had decided to do and so we just kind of produced it right that doesn't yeah um i guess <grunt> i don't know <laughter> uh i don't know it's been a it's been a while since i've really thought about that i don't know would i go somewhere would i i i i don't know thank you,1
368,<synch> <sniffle> yeah i'm okay with it um i'm okay i'm okay um i guess scrubbed_entry i'm basically an l_a kinda guy cool um you know the weather it's usually pretty sunny and and temperate you know i like the the climate really a lot uh i like the girls here you know um i like uh let's see i don't like the traffic you know but um i like the hispanic population quite a bit you know um and i have a lot of friends here so i guess you know i don't wanna be anywhere else i mean like i said the traffic you know i was on the four o five you know that's always kinda you know crummy the cost of living that's really you know terrible about l_a it's always expensive and um you know i really don't like <sigh> i really don't like you know the the like it just seems like um l_a's one of those places where like you're you know you either have like a a you know a ton of money and fame and fortune or like you know you're down in the you know the ghettos you know i have i've been to a couple places um uh you know but very brief you know mostly it was for school um i went to arizona and new york and montana lot of the anthropology like you know and archaeology field trips and things like that um nothing i'm doing in right now uh i like getting away from um <laughter> the city you know i was in yosemite last year you know in the summer for vacation that was kinda nice you know yosemite was really um really neat to see but uh just basically getting away from the city i guess you know getting away from the job getting away from um the stress here uh i actually studied political science and i also studied economics um i'm a big kind of a political you know junkie you know to begin with so i naturally kinda fell in line with that kinda field of study i was i was but i lost my job and you know that's kind of a bummer you know um i lost it's uh geez it's already been maybe a year and a half by now maybe two years and um you know the economy uh got bad and the budget cuts got bad and you know um i wish i was working there again uh <laughter> well i um wanted to be a lawyer at one time i wanted to be a lawyer and i um and that's why i took political science and i took a double major in economics and uh the sad thing is the sad thing i i regret is i eh you know to get into law school you have to take this entrance exam called the lsats and i studied for it like really hardcore you know for about a year and i took the xxx test and like a idiot um i didn't feel right about the that day it was kind of an off day and you know it was like you know the big game at the superbowl you <y> you know i just um i don't <do> i don't feel like i did well and i canceled the test and so um you know i kinda regret that you know <laughter> tell me about it um i'm not really shy at all i'm definitely not shy um but outgoing i mean not one of these people <peo> i'm not flamboyent you know um i i'll talk to people i don't mind talking to people i don't mind um meeting <mee> meeting people that's fine with me but it's not like i'm you know dying to to dying to meet anybody <laughter> you know <laughter> i guess um these days uh you know i play guitar you know i taught myself how to play guitar um uh yeah thank you thank you i you know i i should've i should actually be doing more of it but i also like to exercise um uh i'm on a diet right now but my diet's been terrible time the eating habits have been terrible but the exercise part is just great i love to exercise <exerci> i love to run that's one of my best things to do for stress is like run and like work out um i just wish that my eating habits were were in line uh or a little bit better you know <sniffle> um <sigh> my temper could be you know definitely improved uh a lot you know um you know a lotta times i i feel i'm one of these introvert types persons when it comes to like you know i don't mind being extrovert or like meeting people and like having a good time whatever when uh when i'm mad i really don't wanna be you know talking to people i don't like to yell i don't like to scream i don't like to hit i don't like to fight i kinda close down a lot i don't i just wanna be left alone sometimes i tend to drag it on for longer than it should be you know uh the wife doesn't like it too much and maybe i you know i just don't i just don't wanna talk about it <laughter> i just don't wanna deal with it i kinda close down and shut you know shut off for a little bit geez um you know it doesn't happen too often maybe with my wife you know we were probably something silly who knows who knows um the thing i i mean i don't have a lotta guilt i don't do anything like to make me ever feel like you know that bad of a person you know um there are things that like you know um i call minor sins you know i get white lies or whatever you know but like nothing like so atrocious that makes me feel like guilty um let's see i guess sometimes you know um you know i i'm a married guy but i you know sometimes there are times you know i like to you know smile at a girl or like you know get a girl's attention you know i don't know i never go i never do anything about it i never get their phone number or like you know but sometimes i like to like talk to people i guess you know well that's a good question i guess i guess you know see i always handle it the same there's not i don't ever wish to ever to ever change i i never wanna like handle things differently i always kinda i'm pretty comfortable the way i handle things and you know i think that um i could be a lot worse and like you know shouting and screaming and hitting and this and that and that's just not me um you know i think the best thing to do you know is kinda like get a lot of breathing room a lotta space and um i don't wish for that to change or to handle any of that differently i just don't basically know what else to do you know um and you know the last thing i wanna do is start talking about you know feelings or any of this you know that's the last thing i wanna do and so like i don't wish that i handle things like that differently in that way well um you know i'm pretty happy with my family right now um you know if i'm married and we have a baby along the way which is kinda nice um we have some cats thank you thank you we have cats and a dog a weenie dog and um my mom i i love my mom dearly um uh she has diabetes which you know she doesn't control you know she doesn't control it and like it like uh it affects her health and it always has me worried about her and like stressing out about her and and she could do so much to like prevent it and she doesn't and um you know i have a good relationship with my mom i i love her dear dearly and i actually have a good relationship with everybody i think i think i have a ton <to> ton of of family and friends um that get along with me pretty well actually you know yeah um <sigh> there are times well i mean it's pretty easy for me to go to sleep actually i i feel like you know i sleep like a baby um the only problem i have i think is i feel like um you know sometimes like you fall asleep and you have you you're just going to sleep and you kinda like jolt you know like you almost kinda like fall eh it's like a falling sensation or something like that and it doesn't happen eh that often but it happens and um but for the most time <ti> part um no i sleep like a rock i sleep really good <sniffle> well right now generally i've been feeling um worried and and anxious and um you know uh and tense and the reason why is 'cause i said my mom um right well at least today well i found out my mom something she didn't tell me the whole story and i'm kinda waiting 'til this is over so we can i can find out what's wrong with her but um you know i'm worried about her she's in the hospital <ho> she's in the doctors right now so that doesn't tell me anything good and um you know um trying to find a job so that has me worried too and you know the baby along the way so that has me worried so i feel like <sharp inhale> you know overwhelmed with a just a lotta like you know things to do and like and um a lot on my a lot on my plate and like a lot of it doesn't have anything to do with me but i have to handle it like you know so like i guess well um i keep myself distracted i keep myself busy i i feel like a busybody you know and the more um which kinda seems <se> you know seems like it's not a good thing because i feel like i'm just adding more things on my plate so um you know like one of the things i do is like exercise and so i have to work out every day you know but that takes an hour that takes an hour to like you know change <ch> change and you just start running and like go through the whole thing of stretching and and cooling down that takes it takes some time and then like to shower all that kinda stuff takes <ta> takes time so but i have to do it daily so i cope with it in that way i also cope with it too you know playing guitar but that just more of a distraction you know what i mean keeping you know keeping busy that way it just seems like it's not you know um working towards you know the goals you know that i need to do like you know finding <f> finding a job which i should be doing but then um you know it's one of those things where like i find like there's no good jobs i've been looking and looking and like sometimes when i do it it it's just not what i wanna do it just doesn't seem like <laughter> like i wanna like uh do any of these like terrible jobs i xxx it's you know it's it's probably harder than i'm thinking about it because sometimes i i i feel like um you know one of these things is like uh i feel like um it is hard but it's not i mean there are ways i can cope with it you know i just gotta kinda i kind of accepted it a lot you know i kinda internalized it and like uh you know it's not something that's like i'm not out on the streets or anything like that <laughter> but uh you know it is a worry i've never been diagnosed with p_t_s_d i used to work with no no <grumble> man <sigh> uh ten years ago <laughter> i don't know uh let's see the last time i was really happy maybe i mean nothing i feel like nothing makes me happy no more you know um i learned a new song on the guitar feel <fe> i i feel like not even happy about that you know i feel like um you know i work sometimes and that kinda makes me happy you know running like you know fast and working out but that doesn't make me so excited or anything like that it just makes me feel good you know so i i have these these these times where i'm just you know feeling good about myself and i'm feeling you know but i'm never feeling great i'm never feeling happy i'm never feeling like so sensationalized like you know and and and uh you know incredible that you know um it just eh you know there's these there's these mild times where there's a a few good times you know and a few bad times but the good times are no never <n> never <ne> never extremes you know never really good times and never really you know atrocious bad times you know well i wish this diet would work out a little bit better you know but that's kinda hard you know 'cause i'm the kinda guy who just likes who just likes you know um you know rice and and like uh mexican food and like <sharp inhale> you know um and to snack and uh i don't know um i just feel like that could i could change i wish i could change my eating habits that way i can like you know 'cause i work out so much i feel like i do so much running and so much activity that like um you know that if i got my you know diet in check um you know that that would um go a long way um i wish i also can change you know um my <m> my my uh i guess my my desire to like you know get ahead like right now i feel just so um like the economy's so bad and like things are so um rough that you know it's like pointless to even like you know look for these kinda jobs so like it just seems like i just wish i had a little bit more inspiration a lot more motivation to like to um <laughter> <sigh> do things <sniffle> the one thing i regret is is not is not um you know is this this lsat thing you know um you know not uh uh canceling the test to begin with 'cause i'm sure i could've got into a a school but then again like you know it has me thinking like do i really wanna pay a bunch of like you know law school tuition and the cost of that and like you know just to um just to be piled on with more work and things like that eh i don't know <sigh> it just doesn't seem like like uh i mean there is a this idea of justice and and um and republicanism and you know things that i really you know adhere to that um i fall in love with and that i don't wanna get away from but it just seems like it's a like it's a ton of work and money and just to like um it for the smalls percentage of success that that you know you might not be really doing that kinda field you might you know i might <mi> it just doesn't seem like like um it's worth overcoming the obstacles i need to overcome ugh <sigh> i have no idea i would <laughter> i would <wou> twenty years ago i would tell myself maybe um you know i think i've done everything really well for myself except for the the lsat thing you know which i i you know regret on one hand on the other hand you know i i'm not sure if i regret 'cause like eh about the bills and all that kinda stuff i told you about and you know i think uh you know i i've waited to get married i waited to have a kid i've i've you know pretty cautious about the decisions <deci> you know i don't take drugs i don't drink i don't fight i don't do any of these like things that like you know that i think that real people have you know um and then they they really like you know ruin their life you know so like i'm pretty happy and content with being you know the cautious you know uh <sigh> i don't know oh my best friend i think he he kinda like <li> he likes me he wishes that i would do more things with him but he works at night and and you know it's one of those things i think most people not just my best friend but my wife and might be but rest of my family feel that i don't put a lot of time and attention to them i mean they think that i'm pretty great when i do give 'em the my time of day and my attention but um i don't know if i'm really there all the time you know i don't know if i'm really you know i'm always thinking about something else i'm always thinking about something different i don't <don> i don't know if i really can give 'em eh a a real you know shoulder to cry on or you know if they ask for something you know i'll i'll usually do it you know but i almost feel like it's like a chore like you know like if they you know if they really need me then i'll do it you know eh if they're just asking for a favor i almost feel you know i do it half you know with a lotta lackluster lotta half-heartedness i just feel <f> and it's not because i hate 'em or anything i really like 'em it's just that i feel like i almost i don't wanna say i owe it to them but the mere fact that i'm their friend makes them somehow um you know uh like i eh it it makes me like you know they rely on me some you know times or like i don't wanna let 'em down they are my friends but it's the same time i i just feel like it's it's more it's not it's not it's more of like a chore to do instead of a a willingness like a oh my god like i just wanna help you it's never <ne> it's never like that it's just something that i do because i have <ha> kinda have to you know you gotta you know gotta do things for your friends you know in the end because they're your friends you know and i in in the end i do like 'em and they probably would do it for me and i you know so i just do these things you know just um well there are a couple a things that i do like uh that i've good <go> i feel good about myself you know um you know i ran the l_a marathon that kinda feels good you know i've graduated from college that kinda feels good you know what i mean but the thing is i don't feel like like that proud of myself for you know those things alone like graduating from college you know hasn't really made me successful you know what i mean um running the marathon hasn't made me thin and trim so they're like half merits you know or like they're they're great you know lotta people maybe not half done it a lotta people have excelled further but um you know they're kinda like stepping stones that like that um i've seal real new no life <l> lifelong benefit from doing other than the fact that i can say that i've done yeah yeah no problem no problem thank you for your time you know um hope you enjoy you know uh being in this computer <laughter> oh goodbye i'm gonna press this button now,0
369,<sync> <ellie starts> sure yeah i'm doing great thank you for asking um you know how about yourself <laughter> oh awesome uh i'm from guatemala my parents here migrated here to the united states when i was like three years old so yeah mhm yeah it's pretty cool you know uh i haven't been there actually i haven't been back to my hometown since forever uh just you know i have all my family here my mom my dad my cousins aunts uncle so practically i i have my my life here so i probably i mean it would be nice to visit but you know it just does my curiousity hasn't you know gone there i guess oh okay um i love the people everyone's nice i love the diversity you know there's different types of people and you know the imaginations out there everything is just great you know everyone's different you know no one's like the same at at least to some aspects um and i love the scenery i love the you know mountains they're beautiful you know great for hikes you know taking out you know the dog the family you know it's nice it's pretty active yeah uh the smog <laughter> uh i don't like the smog it's just you know if you go out um further out you know you could tell by the air you know or you know everything's clearer the sky is bluer <laughter> um but other than that like you know and traffic <laughter> nobody likes traffic i think yeah yeah but um yeah that's you know pretty much l_a is pretty nice you know it's i like it um well i was studying just basic you know um i'm not sure exactly what i wanna be so it's just kind of you know here and there just jumping through hoops and stuff so not really set yet it's just i'm still trying to find my interests i suppose so um my dream job hm that's a good one um i love working with children so i would say probably a child psychologist just 'cause you know it's great you know to learn what's going on in the young minds and you know how we could help children develop a better way you know make children you know or help you know help them you know grow up in a positive way i supposed instead of like going the wrong track yeah i just you know help children uh it depends it depends on the situation i'm in sometimes you know i could be like super outgoing and just like you know and sometimes like it just i could be all quiet or whatnot and just paying attention you know if i'm like in class or whatever i don't really like and there's everyone talking i just i'd prefer just to stay away from that you know 'cause i need something else to concentrate on something else you know there's like a moment and time for everything i suppose yeah um i like to kick my feet up on the couch and like read a good book you know just get my mind going to another you know galaxy or universe or situation you know it's pretty fun you know just you know reading and then just having just yourself relaxed and you know feeling good yeah it is it's just fun i love reading um i'm okay with it i'm not like the best you know temper controlling person there is out there you know i try my best and i guess that's all i could do until i keep doing better eventually but i'm not like the best i mean i sometimes i do have my outbursts you know um but you know i guess that's everyone i'm not sure haha you know uh huh that's a good question um hm i don't remember <laughter> uh let's see uh honestly i can't recall maybe uh my goodness i i don't know <laughter> i've i've uh sometimes i'm very passive that i'll just like let things go 'cause i mean what's the point of making a big deal out of things you know so um huh i don't know i'm not i i i can't honestly i can't tell you that <laughter> at this moment sure yeah probably come back to it um huh well i guess when i was younger i you know uh could've been better older sister and i i wasn't and that makes me feel guilty for sure you know i could've been a better sister better role model <laughter> you know but i'm trying my best now so i'm trying to make things better and it's working <laughter> yeah woo um i guess huh hm i don't know i mean i'm the person that i am because of the events that have happened in my life so if i erase something then it just there's something of me in my present self or you know that would change and i don't know i'm pretty okay with the person that i am now i mean you know i don't think i would change an event you know i'm i'm okay with what you know ups and downs and good and bad that has happened so yeah uh i can't see your shoes but um i don't travel a lot um but i am kind of like an explorer i guess i love to explore like even the smallest things like if i go hiking i go off trail and you know just find my way up to the top you know somehow some way and just make it you know um traveling uh i would love to do that but i don't know just you know always circumstances in my life that doesn't you know always something you know i'm getting married children you know and all this so it's kind of like you know it would be nice i guess you know it would be nice you know i love camping that's kind of like you know it's taking a few days trips out there camping and you know fishing <laughter> yeah um hm it was this summer you know me and my husband went camping and it was really nice it was just me and him you know and it was like no one and it was like beautiful because it was just in the middle of the woods with a beautiful lake and you know it was it was really nice it just yeah yeah yeah yeah it was it was it was really fun  it was like i would love to do it again you know right now it would be great you know just going out there it's just i love the adventure of things and the nature and just life and you know overall yeah uh it's it's easy but lately i haven't been able to sleep like at night right away because i don't know just you know just i'm laying there and i'm just like trying to go to sleep and i'm just like ugh but eventually i do <laughter> you know i just i probably like need to position myself on a different side of the bed like sometimes i'm i'm in the headboard and i'm like ah i gotta go to the other side and once i position myself then i just like go to sleep you know but it just i gotta find the position <pos> the right position for me yeah um i'm tired <laughter> i get tired throughout throughout the day you know but i kind of try to shake it off you know and just kind of like feel like it's a new day you know and just try to make the day that i have as great as possible you know and then try to like make it up by sleeping at night the day of <laughter> you know so yeah yeah yeah it's just you know it's okay i try to make it the best i guess if not then i just go to sleep throughout the day which sucks but yeah uh no <laughter> no uh been feeling good yeah i've been feeling really good um you know a lot of things in my life have you know it i'm having a really good year so far so i'm very happy with that you know everything's you know going good you know yeah it is it is except that i i just got out of a cold and it was horrible but that's just nature <laughter> my immune system has to work harder <laughter> yeah um super happy was uh when the doctor told me i was pregnant you know i was really really happy about that and i was just like ah you know <laughter> that was really really good you know very excited and just reading about what's going on with my body and what's going on with the baby and oh that's very overwhelming and it's scary at the same time <laughter> i've never really like uh you know but yeah i've yeah very happy uh um i don't know um i guess just me myself i uh you know like you know i could you know just be myself and that's it you know just i can't really you know say i have specific thing i guess i mean it depends on the person that meets me to tell me i can't really tell myself like oh i'm this i'm that just you know just try to be my best and try to portray something good for other people to tell me or you know compliment me or what not yeah um <laughter> nothing i think <laughter> um like i said i'm i'm happy with the person i am right now and you know my flaws or whatever you know i might have whatever flaw people see in me and it'ts okay you know i'm okay with it whatever it just i'm not gonna i'm i can't change myself for the likings of other people <laughter> i have only one body and one life so yeah yeah that's it uh just my childhood with my sisters and my family but you know it's you know i you learn from that you learn from the past and you kind of feel like hey you know maybe i should be a better role model you know for my children and so my children could be better role models so the world could just improve um just smile and be happy you know and whatever hard things happen you know you're gonna get through them eventually you know the only thing you can't um i don't know you can't you know go back on is death you know you could you know the heartbreak or it's whatever but you know as long as i'm alive i'm just i still gotta keep going yeah <laughter> um i don't know um that's pretty huh most proud of i guess that i'm trying my best to be the best i could be and that's pretty powerful you know i i'm you know i try to be you know a better person each day and try to like you know improve myself every day as much as i can you know that would probably be something i could be super proud of you know as much as i can very hard <laughter> i'm not gonna lie um it is really hard you know 'cause i can't say you know it's easy to be bad but it's hard to be good you know and you know it's it's always challenges and everything that goes you know in your life but you know it's just it's it's sometimes you know hard you know and sometimes it comes easy you know after a while you get a lot of practice and everything's just like you have a great day and you didn't even try <laughter> you know so yeah um you know loving friendly um outgoing you know adventurous i guess i don't know i guess that's what they say <laughter> i i just you know that's them like you know but that's what at least what i try to be you know at least i try to give a the best foot forward always as much as possible you know even sometimes even if i'm having a rough day i'm just like uh you know you know i just i don't wanna take it out on anyone or anything you know yeah um <laughter> my ideal weekend usually i i like going to the park i like sitting down in like a tree under a tree actually under a tree where there's shade and just kind of like put my blanket out there have my dog and like read a book and you know sometimes if i don't have my dog like there's little squirrels running around and they like me to feed them so that's pretty neat you know just sitting there and just enjoying the air and the noise <n> noise i guess 'cause there's not silence you know the wind and the cars and you know it's just it's really neat yeah awesome thank you you're welcome <laughter> bye,0
370,<synch> yeah i'm doing pretty okay thanks for asking how are you uh i'm from here in l_a i grew up in the san fernando valley yeah uh <sigh> well i i like the the diversity of people the different kinds of food you can eat i like um the outdoor opportunities i grew up close to the hills so i i did a lot of hiking um camping is pretty close by i've gone snowboarding um i like eh the familiarity i think and you know it's it's a big city and uh you know i'm pretty familiar with it having lived here for so long that that i i i would say i like that too <laughter> probably the number one thing that everybody says i don't like traffic i don't like being stuck in traffic i don't like <deep breath> uh the long commutes even you know for short distances um and then you know it gets really hot in the summer at times so you know that eh i could stand it being a little <lit> slightly cooler when it gets to its peak peak heat but that's fine wow my dream job uh <sigh> that's a great question i <laughter> i think my dream job would probably be uh you know maybe being able to travel and somehow make money off of it profit off it you know make gainful employment off of traveling but that's almost an unrealistic dream since i don't know if i would actually wanna do that but if if i had to pick some kind of dream existence you know traveling getting paid to travel meeting new people trying new things and being able to make a living out of that would be pretty fun well i like like i mentioned what i like about l_a i like trying different kinds of food different cuisines so i think trying authentic cuisines in different places and meeting different kinds of people seeing different ways of life uh would be eh is what i like about traveling um i i like experiencing new things um i think that would be nice you know despite the fact that i said i like the familiarity of l_a there's also fun in discovering new things so i i think travel <tr> when i travel that's that's what i like to do just check new things out um so i would like to be you know <laughter> if i could make a living doing that that would be great uh one of my trips okay well let's see the the last trip i i took um lemmi think of one <on> one one more exciting trip um well my my family is from eastern europe so one of the trips i took with my parents when i was fourteen was i i went to um austria hungary and romania and uh you know getting to see some of those old castles <ca> i'd been a few times before but i it was when i was little so i don't really have too much memory plus i didn't really process things quite the same as when i was kinda more of age so i got to see you know my family's old uh you know hometown you know uh we have a family um like tomb so i got to see that then just these old buildings and just the different way of life i i i really liked that uh you know seeing my parents old friends um you know and so that was pretty fun it was very different it was like really my first time being taken away from my my home environment you know i i left in the middle of the school year um so it was just like going from you know suburban america to traveling around kind of uh you know taking these old trains and seeing these castles and these old like hundreds of year old towns and it i i don't know if um it was for everyone you know i don't know <laughter> if it would be great for everybody but i i really enjoyed it uh that's that's a good question i do <sigh> uh i probably one of the things i do is either turn on like a rerun of a sitcom um i used to i i watch the office a lot so i kinda know when that's on so i'll i'll turn that on you know just uh kind of zone out a little bit to uh you know like familiar characters and and hearing jokes that are still funny for some reason or um maybe like uh eating some kinda comfort food you know i try not to eat too much fast food at all but uh like in n' out i really like going there so if i have to unwind um you know it's once every few months maybe i'll do that uh or i really like to read um especially like uh i'll read the day's events you know that that really relaxes me for some reason even if it's reading about something some conflict going on somewhere in the world i i still i'll read the headlines and i really like to know what's going on that kind of centers me um so i i really enjoy that that's something i do to relax i would say <sigh> i'm pretty great at it although i don't i think my nature makes it pretty uh easy <eas> makes that pretty easy i don't <laughter> i don't get very upset <up> upset um easily at all so i it's not much of a challenge to control my temper eh um yeah i don't <do> i don't really have anger issues i it's it's difficult for me to get angry uh so i don't i don't <laughter> i don't really have much trouble with that at all the last time i argued with somebody was probably <sigh> i don't even know i i i mean small disagreements you know i might've had uh with family or friends about things but just a full on argument i i i i can't even remember it's been years i i don't really argue too much i try to avoid conflict as much as possible in my my personal life i don't um really see anything to be gained by and i kind of uh naturally repel away from it so i don't sorry i don't <do> <laughter> i don't have much to say about arguing something i feel guilty about i would say that uh you know sometimes <somet> i eh <sigh> sometimes i don't really um i feel like i maybe haven't made the most of my potential yet in life i i think that i could definitely do more despite the fact that i work a lot um i i feel like i there's always more opportunities uh out there that that we're missing i feel like you know sometimes down time i feel a little bit guilty about that because there's always something that i could be doing that i'm not even if it's just putting away the laundry that that's been um i took out of the dryer that's been sitting there or running late i really don't like running late um although <sigh> it happens more than i'd like to i'd and i don't know why i feel guilty about that i don't like keeping people wait waiting because it makes it feel like uh you know my time is somehow more valuable than theirs which is obviously not true um <sigh> hmm um nothing immediately comes to mind i well <sigh> the last car accident i got into i it was a few years ago i guess i i wish it hadn't have happened not that i wish i i've could erase it from my memory but i eh was um driving in rush hour traffic and you know i i thought the cars in front of me were were going um you know at least for a little you know ten fifteen feet but it turns out they had they had stopped so it was a <deep breath> you know xxx slow rear-end collision but it was still very unfortunate i was just uh you know it felt like i was paying attention one second and the next second you know i was just like reaching for something on the in the passenger seat and then i i smacked into the car in front of me and <deep breath> uh i i wish that hadn't've happened absolutely uh i know <kn> i know it's a minor thing but it was just really unfortunate the timing of it was very bad you know for me financially and the the people i got into an accident with were fine but i was <wa> you know they they you know didn't ask for anything beyond repairing the damages but uh it was just uh horrible timing um <deep breath> so i i wish that hadn't've happened it does suck <laughter> it did suck i'm over it now but eh yeah it it does suck well i'm a pretty good sleeper i although i i'm naturally wired to be up later at night so unfortunately my unfortunately my job um allows me affords me a pretty flexible schedule but at on the same token uh i wish i could <cou> were like hard-wired to go to sleep earlier because i just i wind up staying up 'til one or two every night uh and it's just too late you know even though i could get a full eight hours or whatnot of sleep it's not always at night time you know half my sleep is like in the kinda early daylight hours and i i wish i were more um able to sleep you know go to sleep at like ten or eleven and then sleep uh and then wake up earlier as opposed to going to sleep later and waking up later i've been pretty feeling pretty good i i've been i have no complaints physically and you know health-wise i feel good um you know my relationships with my my family and friends are good uh um everything is great so far i i have absolutely no no real complaints uh as far as how i'm feeling about myself or anything like that no no i've been fairly consistent with my behavior and my thoughts i think that um everything has been been pretty okay pretty steady no no nothing traumatic nothing um kinda resurfacing from the past nothing of the sort has has happened or is happening no no well i think there's plenty of things everybody regrets uh yeah yeah there's there's plenty of things um <sigh> in my life uh yeah like i said i i do regret uh you know maybe not trying harder in my younger days you know i there's a period of time in my early twenties where i i didn't work for a while i just uh i hung out with a lot of friend you know i guess it was like the proverbial bad crowd you know none of us worked we just uh you know we we got high every day um or it seemed like every day i don't know it was just uh eh but it was a it was kinda like a throw-away period in my life i would say that um <sigh> it's important to to to engage with the world i think i i think i kinda dropped out from the world a little bit i think it's also i would say that it's important to um recognize the people around you for what they are you know and what <wha> what kinda potential you know future activities they you can expect from from the people you surround yourself with i think that uh i would say also that um kinda try to focus on what i wanted to do with my life as opposed to just thinking well you know things will work out which eventually they do but i i think that you know there's a bit of lost time with that um that approach it's kinda fatalistic and i i think that i would say you know um just try to concentrate you know you know not <no> not everyone works on the same schedule and life isn't a race but i would say that it was it's important to have a goal in mind or some kind of you know idea for what what you want out of life as opposed to just kinda waiting and um thinking that things will fall into place um <sigh> well i <sigh> i i guess when people i i don't especially um take even constructive criticism particularly well for some reason i i think that for <f> at least for myself i sort of have things figured out although i i i'm sure i'm wrong about that so i think just maybe in terms of like uh group work that i've done professionally or or academically you know when when some of my work is uh kinda picked apart or or scrutinized i don't <d> i don't deal well with that and i i take it more personally than i should uh it was probably about a year and a half ago i was working on a research project at work and uh somebody with much less experience <exp> it was three of us working on something and then they brought it another pair of eyes just to go over it and it was somebody just out of uh college you know um went over what we had done and you know it was just kinda rewording things and it it seemed just like cosmetic changes that were being made just for the sake of of changing things and i kinda took personal offense to that just uh because i thought i had a lot more experience and more education and uh it it was unnecessary you know i i thought that the whole thing was a waste of time and you know i just um i i didn't think that she was somebody that was qualified to to necessarily redo all our work um or or even to uh not not to redo it but to to edit it or to uh <sigh> not <no> eh proofread i guess to to make any kind of you know qualitative changes i i just thought that it was a a really bad idea and and i i thought that i you know i i shouldn't have viewed it this way but i thought that the fact that they brought in somebody with almost no experience you know was kind of like a an affront to us who had worked on it on this project but you know it wasn't our call <sigh> mm most memorable experiences um well i guess the <sigh> first thing that comes to mind is one of my um the first real trip i took by myself uh i i took the uh the amtrak to to new mexico and i was out there exploring things um for about ten days on my own uh so that was kind of the longest period of time up 'til that point and i was in my i was i don't know twenty three maybe at the time that i i'd really just been on my own completely cut off from everyone i was in parts of new mexico where there was no cell phone reception at the time um and it was very memorable because i was on it on my own i felt like i was really uh you know exposed to the things i wouldn't have seen if i had had traveling companions um and it was a lot of fun uh well i've been very happy recently i for the i i'm getting married in a few months uh i got engaged on labor day uh in two thousand twelve thanks <laughter> so i i was uh that was a very happy day this this whole process you know of um of meeting someone and we we kinda progressed very quickly realized where we recognized where we were um so i i've been a pretty happy state the past uh well it's been eleven months now but um yeah so i i think that the day we got engaged and then we we shared it with our family i think those have been very happy times um new years was happy you know uh i i'm in a happy period of my life right now so yeah yeah thank you <laughter> uh <sigh> with a <sigh> sort of um sense of humor that maybe not everybody gets i'd say uh also uh you know um helpful calm relaxed maybe uh <sigh> intelligent um you know likes to recycle i know that's so something that they would say uh i what else i think that um my best friend might say that uh i i i like animals i've always had dogs and cats so they might describe me as a people person or i mean a an animal person excuse me i also um you know fairly easygoing you know flexible with with plans mm uh i'd say one of <sigh> most proud of in my life um hmm <tisk> well <sigh> i i i'm pretty happy with the level of education i've gotten i'm also going back eh starting in the fall i'm starting a p_h_d program so i'm happy about that i'm happy about you know breaking some of my bad habits from the past i i'd say if i'm proud of anything it's that um you know i have a strong faith relationship i go to church often i'm i'm very happy about that i don't know if pride is the right word but um my relationships with my family and friends are all very good uh i'd say maybe the fact that it's a lot different than my life is a lot different than it was about ten years ago you know the the change i'm i'm happy and proud of that no problem have a good day thank you goodbye,0
371,<synch> yes i'm doing pretty good thank you i was born in the san fernando valley in california really <laughter> uh i love the beaches i like uh there's just many things to do and uh you can't beat the weather uh traffic cost of living uh no i haven't uh i've only been out of the country once or a few times actually but only to one other country mm well they were when i was younger before i turned twenty one and we used to uh go to tijuana across the border just to get into nightclubs and stuff like that uh well i love to see new things new places uh and uh have new experiences uh after high school i went to beauty school for cosmetology mm well at the time i was uh looking for a career change and uh i have some friends in the industry and uh i decided to take the classes and see see what i thought uh only as a hobby mm well uh that's a that's a tough one to answer i'd have to think about that i would be on the outgoing side uh just because i'm more outgoing than i am shy <laughter> uh lotta times i smoke marijuana mm not the best uh i had an argument with my mother over uh how we should handle doing things with my grandmother well we just had differences on uh who should do what at what times and who's in control and uh i should pretty much let her uh follow her rules because it's you know she's her daughter well it's okay i understood we talked it out and you know realized that uh i might've been uh overstepping my bounds uh it's fairly good i am pretty close with my mom and uh my grandmother i have a stepfather and a half-brother we get along okay but we're not very close and i've never met my real father um maybe not accomplishing as much as i should have in my life up to now uh yeah maybe by not having enough uh ambition or drive to be in a better position in my life uh well one of the hardest decisions was when i moved moved uh away from los angeles to wisconsin well when i was younger i was getting in trouble and i was looking for a way out so i went and continued getting into trouble and i <deep breath> with a friend <sigh> uh we just packed our bags and moved to milwaukee yes uh extremely difficult i guess uh i got a lotta things going on or not going on and it just makes it hard for me to sleep um issues in my life and uh sure sometimes mm i guess it depends on what i have to do right now a little well in the last few minutes since we started talking about depressing stuff i starting to feel a little more down i haven't no mm very seldom <psh> stop thinking about 'em mm i don't know i couldn't tell i couldn't answer that right now um i guess i felt uh eh it's been awhile since i've been really happy i don't have uh a whole lot of very happy thoughts as recently mm <deep breath> oh let's see i <sigh> did go to las vegas uh a couple months ago i had a good time there well i'm a honest person for the most part reliable uh i think i'm easy to get along with wow where do i start i have plenty of uh bad decisions i could erase um yeah well i have a d_u_i on my record uh well for the time it suspended my license makes it extremely difficult <diff> makes life extremely difficult well yeah it's uh hard to get around when you can't drive legally and if you do drive illegally you're at risk of going to jail for driving without a license uh well the original charge did but i haven't got caught driving since mm i don't have a best friend mm well let's come back to that one mm maybe that i could uh follow through with some of my plans be a little more ambitious maybe not uh well <we> some of the decisions i've made in my life i have regrets <sigh> uh take care of business first and always handle your responsibilities good <go> uh good weather good music good company good conversation mm <sigh> wow i don't have an answer for ya i love to uh bike ride i can go for walks or hikes uh i love to swim in the ocean mm my mom well she uh she was a single mom with two kids and uh worked really hard to raise us yeah yeah it wasn't easy very sure bye <laughter>,0
372,<synch> yes um pretty good kind of <laughter> yeah <laughter> about los angeles yes the thing i like about l_a the weather it's not easy to meet people well it just feels like people aren't out very much they're like that movie in crash where people are just sit in their cars all the time um it feels like that no not too much child development well i have a son and i wanted to know how to be a a good mom and so i wanted to know about the stages uh that he would be going through eh and be able to relate better to him mhm i am kind of i'm trying to get it started again in the fall i'd like to write well um i've written some children's books and i've just been doing research looking into getting my books published it's only like two that i've written so far but they're pretty good i've gotten some good feedback on them from my critique groups <laughter> it's about a little boy that's surrounded by people that are jerks and he tries to not become a jerk with them and <laughter> it puts him in like a really scrubbed_entry he goes through a lot of moods dealing with the people in his life mhm um no i've had some issues some nervous breakdowns actually and right now my son is staying with his dad so <laughter> um no i'm a single mom it was the hardest thing i think in the world <laughter> is being a single mom <laughter> so how do i cope <deep breath> um <sigh> well right now um i didn't have very many good <goo> coping skills or mechanisms so that was the problem it's so spontaneous like the stuff that comes outta kids' mouths sometimes and the stuff that they do and just brings a smile to your face um well when my son was younger once we were just sitting around the house and he comes and he starts doing my hair and he says to me mom i want you to put on some lipstick and high heels and ponytails so you can go out and get married and find a boyfriend <laughter> so yeah it's pretty spontaneous things like that happen that my kid's telling me i need to not be single anymore <laughter> the hardest thing <sigh> not wanting to screw it up i feel a lot of stress and pressure that every little thing is gonna make <ma> make a difference and matter in what kind of person my kid turns out to be and so it's a lot of stress on yourself <laughter> yeah yeah <laughter> definitely um hmm i think i'm different from my mom because i'm a little bit more tolerant of that spontaneous interaction i welcome it you know i welcome getting to know who my child is right now and not try to mold them into somebody that i want them to be but just see them become the best child that they can be the best adult that they can be without molding them in that direction necessarily into a different person <laughter> so say it again who's someone that's a positive influence um <sigh> mm i don't really have anybody like that okay well i've tried to meditate sometimes but i don't really stick with it often enough um i've tried to like go for walks but i don't always do that and i don't always stick with it <laughter> so yeah that's about it <sigh> i'd say i'm a little below average meaning that i get angry more than most people do i think hmm last night <laughter> but it was on the telephone i was arguing with my husband um we have my sister lives with us and she lives with us in a very small room with a small apartment i should say and she's got four people living in in one room so um it's kind of stressful it's really crowded and my husband is stressed out about it and you know i'm just saying to him that i told you so i told you if my sister moved in here then there was gonna be a mess in the house and she's gonna be asking for things you don't really wanna do that's just how my sister is <laughter> so the house is messy and it's crowded and every day they're asking for rides and my husband he's avoiding coming home because all these people are home and he doesn't wanna be there anymore and i'm just saying that he's gonna have to find a way to deal with it because he asked for it in my opinion <laughter> so <laughter> hmm it does <laughter> oh i've got tons of 'em but right now what's on my mind is um losing custody of my son um right now like i've been arguing with my stepmom and my stepsister for a long time about my son and how they treat him and how i want him to be treated like they don't have any boundaries and i believe that boundaries are important establishing who's the adult who's the child they let my child boss 'em around and stuff anyways because of this they're gonna be testifying against me in the custody trial saying that yeah they're gonna be saying that i'm not a good mom because i believe in having boundaries and we have very different ideas about child raising she's my stepmom she's my dad's fifth wife and she's she really doesn't she's really far removed from how i was raised and i wanna raise my child more similar to how i was raised where you're we had some independence and we had some boundaries and we knew what the rules were and what was expected of us and with my stepmom she xxx no rules she has no expectation she just wants him to run wild and have everything that he wants and that's fine when you're a grandparent but the problem is that i live with them sometimes and when i'm in the same house with them they should be following my rules and not trying to go and break all of my rules <sigh> anyway <laughter> yeah um in that moment <sigh> just really frustrated because they don't listen to me i feel disrespected i feel like invisible i feel just angry that they're taking away my right to parent and it's something that i worked really hard to do i went to school and i studied child development i've read all the magazines and i've read the books and i'm really <laughter> i know what i'm talking about i feel confident in my parenting skills and my parenting abilities and to have these people that haven't done the same thing and worked as hard as i have to be a good parent try and tell me that i'm a bad parent it's really uh hard to believe so i feel very disrespected um unacknowledged angry frustrated all those things <laughter> um i take i take benadryl to help me sleep and i'm so <laughter> my doctor gave me that <laughter> uh she gave me benadryl told me that i could take it to help me sleep and last night i was crying before i went to sleep so sometimes these thoughts start running through your head at night when you're in bed but i tried to push them out and then i got up and i took my benadryl so i could go to sleep more easily <laughter> yeah i'm always thinking about my son how i wish he was with me and how unfair everything is that's happening <sniffle> and like i don't deserve to have my son taken from me because i'm a really good mom you know <sobbing> and i'm too hard on myself so but i am a good mom and i feel confident that i'm a good mom i just i don't really have the money to take care of my son like my dad the son's dad does he has more money than me and right now i'm trying to be okay with it because i know he can do more for him financially than i could but that doesn't mean i'm not a good mom <laughter> hmm i'm pretty depressed i'm on anti-depressants um i take wellbutrin i been on them for a couple weeks now i think they're working i don't know i'm not as down as i was i mean i got here today i got dressed <laughter> i made it out and i'm here today so not that bad um <sigh> hmm my husband complains a lot he says i'm not the same person that i was when he married me he said i was fun and i was positive and i was all these other optimistic things that's another thing he was on the phone telling me last night and <sniffle> and i'm not those things anymore <laughter> which is true i mean we got married a year ago and then my son was taken shortly after and it was just such a shock and um i've just been trying to get back from it but it's been hard did i think i had a problem before i found out found out what oh um yeah like crying a lot something like i cry all the time <sobbing and laughing> it doesn't take much for me to cry i'm just crying thinking about crying but like um my family would invite me to family events and i would go and just just cry because my son wasn't there <sniffle> or um i don't know it's just all the crying i think and like i said my husband letting me know that i'm not the same person so he's disappointed and i feel bad even that <crying and laughing> i'm not the same person that he he knew <crying and laughing> i feel bad about that too another thing i'm feeling bad about you know <crying> yes i do i try do i feel like the therapy's useful um yeah it's nice to talk about your problems i go in there and i cry every week so at least i have a set time every week where i can go in and cry <laughter> um that's i mean it's a release to be able to cry sometimes i feel better afterwards um yeah and she helps me make decisions you know help me to be more proactive in my life um well i'm looking for jobs and things like that and she gives me ideas of why don't you work here or why don't you work there or have you thought about this or that you know and then she said something about why don't you go back to school and so i went and applied to go back to school you know i'm not doing much with my life and sitting around all day isn't helping my depression any either so i'm trying to find a work and i applied for college in the fall i got accepted to dominguez hills so i may be going back to school in the fall right now i'm still looking for work but she helps me with that kinda stuff just giving me ideas that life isn't over <laughter> that there's still more you know i could be doing with life life yeah everything's always bittersweet um i don't know last time i was really happy i don't know <laughter> my ideal weekend oh i don't have a lot of money 'cause i'm not working right now so really my weekends are just spent reading maybe but i can't really i i can't pay much attention when i'm reading so <laughter> i have a short attention span i can only read a couple chapters <deep breath> um but lately i say that's what i've been doing is reading something i've read xxx okay i like to go to u_s_c they have these nights where they have things like book signings or poetry and art it's called visions and voices so i like to go out to <t> to their events and i usually enjoy those um about two weeks ago um deborah harkness was there doing a book signing for a discovery of witches and so like i said i'm trying to be a writer so i try to go especially to the book signings and see what it's like to be an author who's talking to a crowd and signing books <laughter> my son <laughter> i don't have any friends my best qualities um <sigh> i'm smart i'm good-looking um i'm really um and like a hard worker i i'm dedicated to like self-improvement um that's all i can think of right now <laughter> okay okay goodbye press the buzzer now,1
374,<synch> yes pretty good alexandria virginia mhm uh i moved to l_a uh end of two thousand one yeah it's crazy <laughter> um a couple times a year usually like for holidays hmm <sigh> it is <sigh> it's very different um i think it's a lot more mellow um it's way more like suburbia it's nice um it there's something comforting about it but it's always like i get a little restless when i'm there and look forward to coming back here where there's a little more action <sniffle> i went to um grad school at u_s_c um it was it wasn't bad i mean my my program that i was in was so intense that like for the first year it was so all consuming that i really didn't have much spare time to think about the adjustment it was just like i <laughter> my life was not my own so that made it kind of um easier i guess and also i was like in a community of people that i went to school with so automatically i knew people and you know made friends and stuff so it wasn't bad film hmm <sigh> i uh had an epiphany one day um i was out of undergrad i was kinda floundering a little bit i didn't really know what i wanted to do and um just one day i kinda was like you know what am i really excited about what am i really passionate about and um i realized that movies <m> movies are the thing that i love the most and am most passionate about so that is how i decided to go to film school um a little bit yes and no it's i don't i'm so <s> i'm like in a little bit of a transitional period right now but yeah like for the last several years i've been uh producing like freelance producer <sniffle> <sigh> that is so the question of the moment <laughter> um i think that uh i don't necessarily have like a a job title that's my dream job but i knowit's sort of what um i want and 'cause basically like i've been living a freelance lifestyle for a while and i know that that is like exhausting and i don't wanna do that anymore so i'm looking for something that's stable um you know full time nice benefits and um i definitely wanna stay in the entertainment industry um and i like you know what i love about producing is that it's just like there's constant challenges and you sort of never know what is gonna get thrown at you that i that's you know it's always interesting and exciting um so i'm sort of trying to figure out right now what would be a good place for me to be where i can be reasonably challenged and you know have sort of a like room to to grow and advance and all that <sniffle> yeah <laughter> i can't see your shoes um i i like to travel um i don't know that i haven't really been doing it a lot lately but i have you know in the past done a fair amount um i love the adventure of it just you know new experiences new places new people um i think it's just good to sort of get out of your little insular world and see what's out there and just you know see beautiful remarkable places and just and things and just experience different ways of living and different languages and different cultures <sniffle> um let's see i went to costa rica a couple years ago um my like best friend from growing up she and i went for like ten days  and it was that's probably that might be like my favorite trip of all time <laughter> like it was really awesome but <laughter> costa rica is just like amazing and beautiful um and we just spent like we went to three different places and um just did a lot of exploring and like sightseeing we did a ton of hiking which was amazing and then like the last place where we ended up was this little beach town so by that point it was like we felt like you know we had done all this like amazing physical exertion like doing ziplines and all these hikes so that by the time we got to the beach it was like we've earned the right to just like kick back and relax and you know so it was just it kind of it hit all of the you know it like fed that sort of desire for adventure and activity um but it also i'm also a big fan of vacations where you just like veg out and relax and like lie on a beach with a book so it sort of hit everything <sniffle> <laughter> what do i do to relax um <sigh> i i mean depending where i am like if it's you know if i'm like at work or something and i'm stressed out i just will you know kinda take a minute and just like breathe really deeply and try to just calm myself down that way um if i'm home i might just like you know throw on a movie or like a t_v show that i really like and just that gives a sense of like sort of escape relief <sniffle> um pretty good i don't i mean eh it takes a lot to get me very angry it doesn't happen very often <sniffle> um the last time i argued with someone was <laughter> my mom and it was about money <laughter> <deep breath> um i felt really frustrated because i felt like she was like judging me unfairly and that was upsetting yeah <laughter> um it's good uh you know they live across the country from me so i don't get to see them that often but like i usually talk to my mom on the phone probably like once a week and my parents are really supportive <sigh> um they are you know like when i go back home to visit like i enjoy <en> i enjoy hanging out with them we have a good time um so i'd say we have a pretty pretty good relationship <deep breath> something i feel guilty about um <sigh> <makes sounds with mouth> i guess because i'm like in this sort of job hunting phase i feel guilty sometimes that i'm not like doing enough you know like there are times where like there are days where maybe like i should've sent out a few more resumes or done more stuff like i i feel guilty sometimes for not being like productive enough <sniffle> <deep breath> um <sigh> usually it's pretty easy the last the last couple weeks like has been uncharacteristically like not as good i'm not really sure i haven't figured it out but um i've just had more uh like nights where it either takes me a really long time to go to sleep or i wake up in the middle of the night for no reason um i've also been having a lot of like really weird intense dreams that like i wake up sometimes i wake myself up sometimes <laughter> because i'm talking which is weird <laughter> um so yeah it's just i i don't know not that i have been able to identify i mean i guess maybe i'm like more stressed than usual just 'cause like i my job situation is like in flux but i i don't know there was no like event <sniffle> cranky <laughter> i value good sleep <laughter> and i'm so i'm used to it so it's just yeah it's not a good feeling <sniffle> um not really no yes <deep breath> um <sigh> like <sigh> i think in like october or november although this is actually it's the second time it's happened in my life but the first time was like many many years ago <sniffle> um i felt like i was a really low and like too low for me to get myself out of it <sniffle> um <sigh> just having a hard time functioning on the most basic level like just getting up and taking a shower and like going to the grocery store and you know answering emails was just like it took so much energy um so yeah i just i wasn't  really functioning normally  yeah yes yes um <laughter> sometimes more than others but yeah overall i would say so <deep breath> i think that therapy is good for me because it helps me focus on my sort of patterns um and also like ah just like observing how i am like responding to certain situations and just it i guess it's <deep breath> it gives me a more heightened like kind of self-awareness um so that as opposed to just like um kind of just reacting to situations i'm like mm just like noticing more what is going on um and it just helps to um i don't know it's just helpful <laughter> i don't really <real> i don't really know how to explain it <laughter> <deep breath> <sigh> hmm <sigh> um i don't know um i <laughter> it's <laughter> probably not good that i can't think of <laughter> i can't think of anything <sharp inhale> um eh maybe over uh over christmas being at home with my family yeah um well it just was that was like i was kind of like just starting to come out of my depression then and um like you know i live alone here i have i have a dog but so i just had a long period of feeling not <laughter> great and just sort of doing it all on my own and kinda wishing that my family was around me um so when i was there with them it just um it just felt very like safe and comfortable and that just sort of like you know warm familial embrace <laughter> <laughter> um <sigh> <laughter> i think she would describe me as funny and smart and um a good listener nonjudgmental um i don't know <laughter> is that enough <laughter> <deep breath> hmm <sigh> okay um so this happened the the last like job that i had i mean i was it wasn't technically i was a freelancer but i was working for this company for like a year and a half close to two years and uh i had a it very small company the boss <bo> had a really good relationship with my boss um and he sort of <clears throat> he sort of out of nowhere uh mm told me that he was like downsizing basically and um essentially like the arrangement that we had is that he paid me like a monthly retainer for my services and then on top of that i would get paid fees per project so he like sat me down on this conversation and was like you know our major client that is like you know the bread and butter of the company they're the they're really cutting back like you probably notice things are getting really slow and i was like yeah and he's like so i'm gonna <onna> i'm gonna <onna> have to stop paying you your retainer and this was a total surprise but i was just like okay and he went on to talk about how he i would still have the right of first refusal of all the projects that came through the door and you know because of that he made it seem like you know even though i wouldn't be getting the retainer anymore he would throw enough work at me still that like i wouldn't you know it wouldn't be like a dramatic decrease in the amount of money that i was making <cough> excuse me but um and he was like you know this has nothing to do with the quality of your work i love working with you you're fantastic yada yada so to make a long story short what ended up happening is he was firing me um and he that was his way of basically like phasing me out of the company and letting me go because from that point he stopped calling me he stopped emailing me and later on like a couple of months down the road i um i had to go back into the office because there were a couple projects that were still ongoing like the client took a really long time to get back with their notes and when i was in there i saw that um this guy who had worked with us a bunch kind of like if we needed another producer like if we were slammed we would bring him on to do sort of additional stuff he was doing my job so yeah so it just like it was a really <rea> <laughter> it was a really shitty way to be like fired without being told that i was fired um and it was just like that uh the reason i would like i if i could i would erase that from my mind is because i can't really think of another situation that made me feel so like angry and frustrated and just like in a way that's like that still even though this was like you know several months ago feels very unresolved and still makes me kinda like angry when i think about it so yeah that was a very long explanation but that's what i wish <laughter> <deep breath> um <sigh> let's see i um a very loyal person <deep breath> um i am smart i'm organized i <deep breath> um very like caring kind um i'm conscientious and i work hard <sniffle> <laughter> uh man i think to uh be more confident and less passive um to really like focus on what i want and the things that i know will make me happy and to just go out and get them as opposed to sitting back and waiting for opportunities to present themselves <sniffle> hmm <sigh> um probably just some of the relationships that i formed with people um just like really you know deep friendships you're welcome bye,0
375,<synch> yes good it's been a nice day the south bay can i ask you that question too oh okay that's where i'm from basically but like the south bay of it not much i've been wanting to move anyways just to get a change-up everybody thinks l_a is like everything it's the best but it's too many people and too much traffic <clears throat> i can't see your shoes <sniffle> driving and seeing new stuff last year i went to sacramento from here and stayed out for like a month living in my v_w bus with my wife it was kinda cool camping just wanted to have fun something different art no a little bit probably doing what you're doing <laughter> i'm really interested in coming up with new ideas and stuff too <clears throat> outgoing <laughter> i haven't been doing much to do relax relaxing lately but i like the beach good i argued with my brother last night actually about him talking to me with with more respect as a person i was mad and i wanted to fight it's good but sometimes they're just they're too caught up in what they're doing to pay attention to other people's feelings like with my brother he's just he's just tense because of his situation and he tried to brush <br> brush it off on me wasting money 'cause i'm married now yeah not doing it something like probably taking some candy from the store no no taking money from my mom when i was like real young 'cause she well i was like i was in junior high school and i think i took like twenty from her purse and bought candy for my friends and i felt guilty though like the same day probably yeah that was probably the beginning of my stupid activities all my life or in the past couple years my wife i'm married to her we've known each other for about two years i met her at an art walk she actually went to u_s_c too the past couple days has been kinda hard but i usually go to sleep good i think i'm kinda snappy <sn> i think i'm snappy positive optimistic yeah i've been thinking more positive positively lately and i wanna put a lot of stuff into action so i've been trying to train my mind into knowing that stuff is gonna come to me speaking to the universe easy if you just try it and do it everybody's got a spirit no no no i just told you i feel positive i was happy yesterday <yester> i happy yesterday 'cause i you know i made a couple good decisions wanting to be positive and stay away from negative people being alive knowing god i don't know i don't know i can't think of something now <laughter> mm i don't think i can have one sex exercising waking up positive and having a good meal in the morning i think driving to sacramento that time no don't smoke cigarettes and watch how you spend your money are you gonna sell my ideas and my my uh <laughter> thoughts i can't think of it right now,0
376,<synch> yes i'm doing okay it's still morning so i'm from the east coast massachusetts yes um i moved to l_a when i was a child with my parents pretty much didn't have any choice in the matter <laughter> um i haven't been back there the last time i was back there was uh three years ago for christmas um l_a's very hustle and bustle there's a lot of people that are angry and a lot of people don't care about the other person here in l_a in which back east the east coast the the thought pattern is a lot different you know your neighbors you're friendly to your neighbors and to anybody that you see in the street so the yeah um well since i was a kid i was fairly young at first it was rough i was getting in trouble a little bit in school but uh after all that surpassed i was <wa> i did fine in high shcool and stuff and even took some college courses um well i love the beach and i love the mountains i like to go hiking um and i like walking along the beach i just live a few blocks away from the beach so it's easy no not at all um just not interested uh i've been to mexico a couple times when i was younger went to ensenada but other than that i'm i'm not interested in leaving the united states especially with what's been going on lately um overseas um <laughter> actually child psychology and i was in the nursing program for a little bit but i had some problems at home which caused me to drop out <sniffle> oh that's alright gah um i don't have one to be honest um i admire people that are doing the job that they love i mean like football players they love playing football and they get paid all that money how great is that <laughter> so um i'm pretty outgoing when i meet somebody at first i might be a little bit reserved because we all when we meet somebody pass judgment um as to if we wanna continue communicating with the person or not and but once i've decided that i like that person or whatever i i talk a lot so yes um i like watching movies i like i used to like reading but lately my concentration level hasn't been so great so it's hard to get into a good book um not good at times i uh i have a some outburst every once in awhile so <s> eh it depends on how angry i get uh yesterday and it was with my partner and um actually to be honest i don't remember what it was about it's just sometimes people can have an ugly attitude and i don't appreciate that and if i feel that i'm being disrespected or whichever i'm gonna stand up for myself so um at times some people may be turned off for my personality because very opinionated and i say what i'm what's on my mind um i do not purposely go and hurt people's feelings or anything of that nature but i won't be bullied and i won't be made i won't back down if i feel like i'm being challenged so um uh last year my mother died so i wish i handled that differently um it upsets <ups> it's upsets me so it's okay um let me see <deep breath> uh <sigh> i think i'm gonna pass on that one too because that'll upset me more so <laughter> <sniffle> that is terrible um sometime uh sometimes actually falling asleep may not be a problem especially you know when you're done working and doing everything that you had to do in a day you're tired but staying asleep is a whole different thing for me because it's like i can't uh i get up and then i'm i'm wide awake i'll go out in the living room turn on the t_v and watch t_v i'm lucky if i get three to four hours sleep um maybe because i do have a lot on my mind uh you know thinking about bills and and the stressfulness of work and and then all this other stuff so that's probably a big burst part of it uh it's it's not difficult it's just frustrating 'cause when your mind goes on overtime mode it eh just affects everything your concentration your sleep your eating everything so i'm a little grouchy especially in the morning i'm not a morning person <laughter> i like the nights but i don't like the morning it's like leave me alone until i get my first cup of coffee yeah so other than that i'm i'm okay um well i've been i've been depressed for quite some time and i'm still having difficulty <diff> difficulty uh 'cause after my mother died four months later my uncle died so i had two deaths last year so i'm still reeling and trying to get myself back together i'm i just recently i've started pursuing like interests that i used to do that i haven't done in a year because of what happened um i just i might get angry a little easier i sleep a lot i eat i overeat um i get tired very easily 'cause i'm not getting much sleep so sometimes it's hard it seems like i'm struggling to get through the day yes i have a uh psychiatrist that prescribes me medication on a regular basis oh i was diagnosed quite some time ago um probably ten to fifteen years ago and it's just something i've never gotten over i don't know whether or not you can so i've always taken the medicine um i was arguing with everybody my family my friends and stuff like that and i was feeling desperate and hopeless and i had attempted to uh take my own life years ago which caused me to be hospitalized and then uh they started treating me i started seeing a therapist so um well right now i'm not going to a therapist because my insurance they'll cover the psychiatrist and not the therapist but i am working with a friend of mine who has <ha> knows some avenues to go to seek <se> seek help for a therapist and i don't know if that's really gonna help me i mean sometime <someti> it depends on what kinda therapist you get sometimes people just sit there and they just listen to you talk and ramble on and you're thinking my god what good is this and the other type is the type that will give you some kinda feedback as to how to deal with the emotions tools to help you deal with your emotions so um like i said i haven't been going to therapy recently just psychiatrist just medication um there's been no changes really i i probably would be doing fine because i was doing great before my mom passed away i was her caregiver and uh even though a lot of times i feeled i felt overwhelmed or lacked <l> uh lacked patience with her uh i still was a heck of a lot happier than i am now so um uh <sigh> i would say when my son was born years ago i'm not a parent anymore he passed away so um and that was difficult as well uh hmm um i'm extremely organized extremely reliable my work loves me because i get everything done that i'm supposed to get done even though sometimes i feel a little scatterbrained and um you know those qualities are are admirable in people that can keep their word and and be responsible excuse me oh i have lots of regrets um uh things that i've done in the past that i'm not too happy about but um you know i met somebody once in my life that had had that saying and you see it on a bumper sticker uh live to never regret so you know you can't go back and make changes it's too late so why you know dwell on the situation but sometimes <so> sometimes it's a lot easier said than done um i'm not the advice kinda get person <laughter> i i you know i don't really give my friends any kind of advice i mean i find most of the times people don't listen to you anyway so why bother um i just state my opinion that's all um well right now i'm on a diet because of my overeating after my mom died i was a lot thinner when she was alive i just went crazy with the food and sleeping a lot you know sleep eat sleep eat and so now i'm kinda like on a diet trying to lose this weight 'cause it's very unhealthy for me um hmm trying to think it's been a long time actually there's really nothing because now i just keep my mind busy i haven't been to a movie in ages i don't i used to go out shopping all the time i don't now um so it's been it uh it's been quite some time since i've been content and happy with who i am and what i'm doing in my life right now um my weekends saturday <sa> uh like on saturday i'm usually working um on sunday is usually clean up day you know do your laundry clean up the house um run some errands go shopping for food you know that kinda thing so it's not if i was younger you know it would be fun you know go out clubbing or whatever but i'm too old for that now xxx um hmm really there's nothing that i can think of um there's nothing that i can be proud of hmm um some a good like comedy or whatever i like to watch that um sometimes my partner might do something stupid which i like because i like make fun of him um but mm just that's it you know go <g> maybe go out for a walk on the beach that's it okay no problem thank you bye,1
377,<synch> yeah go ahead um i'm okay i grew up in wisconsin and i lived in colorado for a bit and then i lived overseas for a little while then i moved to california mhm i moved here at the end of june of last year so i guess it's been what eight months something like that um <sigh> at the most probably twice a year <laughter> well my hometown is uh all of five thousand people  and um there are a lot of cows and barns and farms so the opposite of l_a <laughter> um <sigh> it's a good question i i've always wanted to live in california so but i had been living in in the central coast um and i just had been coming down to l_a like once a month for different business and networking and personal development stuff so um yeah things were were changing in santa cruz for me the client i had who was really the main like financial um main financial source i had that relationship ended so i was totally free to move and i thought well i guess i'll give l_a a try and see what happens so so i gave it a shot and here i am oh not at all <laughter> it's a very very big city um i lived in dublin in ireland it was a which is also a big city but you know european cities are much more condensed and the public transportation is much more easy um and yeah so just getting around here and getting familiar with the city was pretty challenging and uh yeah so <sigh> <laughter> i love to travel i love it yeah i've i i lived in ireland and i traveled um i was in morocco and i was in costa rica um i've spent some time in mexico so yeah um i love <sigh> meeting new people experiencing new cultures and like also not just seeing what's different but seeing what's similar among people everywhere you go um sure well i guess hmm i'm trying to think which was my favorite i mean eh there was amazing things about morocco and costa rica both but morocco was incredible it was like twelve days and we went to three different locations we went up in the atlas mountains which are beautiful and uh yeah it's a really really cool culture so it was fun um <sigh> my trip to ireland i actually visited there which is why i decided to move there so my most memorable moment of that trip i mean there's probably dozens but the first most memorable moment of that trip was um being on a bus and and leaving um dublin and going just out to the countryside and seeing how absolutely breathtakingly beautiful it is i mean it's everyone sees pictures of ireland or you know you see it in films and it's green and lush and gorgeous but when you actually get there and experience it it's it like the pictures don't do it justice so it was incredible yeah um i have an undergrad degree in english and psychology and a psychology minor and i have a master's degree in women studies no i use my english and psychology um i work in marketing communications so i actually do sales so um yeah the psychology definitely comes into comes into play and eh so does my i guess my undergrad degree in english but really like i took that on and and created something out of it because most people who get an english degree just teach and i i wasn't wanting to teach um to guess i'm not clear on the question um okay <laughter> wow um <sigh> you know my dream job is being a a motivational speaker and trainer and coach um and traveling the world doing that and and impacting people's lives and um really contributing to people um my relationship's pretty good actually i i just repaired my relationship with my biological mother who would not she was sporadic i saw her sporadically growing up i lived my dad raised me and then he married my stepmom and um they had two kids together so i grew up and i consider them like the family i grew up with so but i got  in communication with my biological mother um last may and we've been we've you know cleared things up and have been in communication since then so um <mutters> well not sure which moment you mean but if you're referring to being in communication with my birth mother um i mean it was very freeing to just let go of the past and let the past be the past and create something new in the future and eh not just the future but in the present moment with her so yeah i'm shy <laughter> <laughter> um to relax i do a number of things i like to do yoga although i don't have the money for it right now um i love to dance i love to read i love to go to the ocean spend time just staring at the waves and soaking up all those negative ions that really recharges my battery actually probably more than anything else um i like to be with friends um i love art and trying new restaurants um yeah all those things are both relaxing eh i guess they're relaxing in the sense that um i feel connected to the people in my life and to the experiences of my life so yeah yeah um depends if i'm driving not very good but otherwise i'm pretty good at it <laughter> um <sigh> last time i argued with somebody probably would have to be oh no it was with the l_a times about the newspaper delivery yeah that was the last time so yeah the <sigh> um the newspaper that was supposed to show up for the elderly lady that i take care of uh it didn't show up and uh i didn't realize that it wasn't there until um late i don't know afternoon i think early afternoon and then i called them and they said they couldn't send a replacement because it was after ten thirty in the morning which was absurd to me when they made the mistake in the first place so i mean for a service that you know we pay for for every day so um yeah it was i was really irratated and then i found out that the newspaper had been forwarded to a new address and that had not been communicated with me so i was angry with the l_a times i was angry with the people who'd forwarded the newspaper and didn't tell me yeah i was pretty frustrated oh wow there are quite a few of those <sigh> um let me think about one um the other day i had a phone call and i'm in a coaching program and it was from <sigh> one of the coaches in the program and she was um explaining to me that there was an additional call that was going to be we have meetings every week classroom meetings and then we also have coaching calls 'cause we have one particular coach we work with and then she called to tell me that i was going to have another coaching call with um someone who's not my coach and uh that hadn't been explained to me as part of the program so it in that moment it just seemed to me like oh my god i have all these people i have to be accountable to and i'm like eh you know i have to not just be accountable to them but share private things that are happening in my life with these people and it just was i don't know so yeah i wasn't um i wasn't angry i was just i just felt frustrated and a little overwhelmed in that moment and it you know and i talked it out with her and we got through it but um yeah i could've certainly just um been okay with whatever was being asked of me in the at that time and would've made the call go a lot smoother hmm the hardest decision wow there's been a few i guess moving to ireland was probably the hardest decision no it wasn't even the hardest decision it was such an easy decision actually but telling my family about it was challenging um that but the hardest decision was my the first time that i moved uh away from my family i was twenty eight and i decided to i chose to move to colorado and um that was a pretty tough decision 'cause at that point my family had been you know within an hour's drive of wherever i lived an hour hour and a half and now they were gonna be you know um a twelve hour drive away or a plane ride away so that was it was challenging oh lots of things um i loved colorado colorado is a beautiful beautiful state and the weather is so much better than wisconsin and um at the time i was very much into rock climbing and there's just a huge outdoor <outdoo> outdoor community in colorado so there were a lot more people who were um in my age group and or single that was another factor um and were interested in the things i was interested in so colorado just seemed like a really natural fit so yeah and then i i found a a job that i liked the pay was atrocious but um i found some work that was really rewarding and so it all came together and i chose to move yeah uh that was totally unrelated question um <sigh> relatively easily it just depends on like what time i go to sleep if i'm out and i don't get home until eleven thirty then you know then i go to bed late and uh i wake up feeling tired like i feel today but generally i can sleep through the night i've had some pretty anxiety-ridden dreams the last couple of weeks um but even so even when i wake up from those or if i you know stir from those i still can fall back to sleep relatively easily um yeah i'm sure they are i mean i'm in another transition state i'm moving out of out of the <sigh> house that i live in right now where i take care of an elderly woman <sigh> um yeah and i just i have to find the financial means to support me in doing that and it's and she creates a lot of anxiety just in her state of being she's exhausting and utterly depressing so yeah um living with her is pretty hard like it's probably the hardest thing i've ever done and i would never ever choose to do it again if i honestly if i knew what i was getting into i don't think i would've said yes to the situation um i feel trapped and helpless like there's you know nothing i can there's no way out of the situation that i'm in no matter what i do it doesn't get any better i don't <d> i don't i know i'm not getting any kind of work that i want to do and mm my money's not working at all so yeah it feels pretty crappy <laughter> thanks i have in the past yeah oh a long time i was fifteen i think or fourteen so it was over twenty years ago i was suicidal oh yeah i feel down mhm i don't actually no um well i originally stopped with my therapist because we had completed i mean we had worked on what needed to be worked on and i was no longer depressed and um and then i began therapy again later on think i was <wa> it was in my early thirties um and then i we ended that because i'd moved to ireland so yeah i mean depending on the therapist and depending on your intention like i i don't go into therapy thinking oh i'm gonna be in this therapeutic relationship for the next ten years i think that's ridiculous i think you go into therapy to um work on a specific problem and have a solution and have somebody be your sounding board who can see things that you can't see and you know work through that situation and come up with um a strategy for not just that not just creating a solution in that area but also just creating strategies and uh tools for the rest of your life so that you don't have to be in therapy forever <deep breath> <sigh> the last time i felt really happy <sigh> wow huh wow that's pretty sad um it was at least a year ago no i that's not true it was when i um saw my biological mother which was last may my best qualities um <sigh> i'm very strong very strong-willed i um am very supportive and loving and nurturing um i'm easy to be around i'm intelligent and um yeah anything i regret i don't think so no <sigh> don't take life too seriously <laughter> oh my ideal weekend um i spend some time at the beach i'll spend some time with friends um either going out at night you know to a movie or just going out to um a club or a bar or somewhere that we can just sit and chat and be together um maybe go dancing after um and sundays i usually go to scrubbed_entry and then i have brunch with friends and um yeah i go home and sunday night i get ready for the next day so hmm <sigh> i am most proud of um a few things i mean i've moved to places that i wanted to move to and uh so i've done things that have really spoken to me and have meant something you know been dear to my heart to actually um mm achieve those those um goals or those yeah i've done things that i've wanted to do like move to ireland and move to california mhm okay sure bye,1
379,<synch> <sniffle> <sniffle> yes i'm feeling okay little bit tired but for the most part feeling pretty good i'm actually originally from woodland hills which is out in the san fernando valley i was born there and then i moved to lomita which is in los angeles county about mm probably around nineteen ninety three so i mean i'm twenty three now so it's about what yeah nineteen years or so i've been living there yeah <clears throat> some things that that i really like i would have to say you know the beach um you know not so much the traffic don't really care for that but um definitely you know just kinda like the nightlife um you know just people in general i like conversing with others so yeah <clears throat> right yep yeah actually i do i mean i can't see your shoes but um yeah actually i do travel a lot i've been to places like hawaii been to the caribbean i've been to uh let's see <makes sound with mouth> um you know just different places like arizona i've been to oregon washington pretty much all over i would say so but usually mainly like um hawaii and the caribbean mexico as well so yep <clears throat> um i think it's just the experience you know like you can't you can kinda experience the culture um different people you know just just the whole background the scenery it's just you know it's it's something new to experience i would say something that you know people haven't seen before so <clears throat> well let's see i recently took a trip to hawaii a couple months ago that was back in december it was around christmas time new years so that was pretty fun we went to a couple different islands we went to uh let's see i think it was kauai went to oahu uh maui you know places like that so <clears throat> yep um you know i would have to say that um you know probably like in hawaii or like the caribbean you know just like i said before the whole experience factor just seeing um you know new different things things that are unique so <clears throat> yeah i actually study journalism right now i'm in my final semester so i'm about <bout> to graduate couple months <clears throat> yep well you know it's kinda funny 'cause you know i started off at a uh you know a two year community college and so you know i was going into uh like business management something to do with you know i think <thin> basically um accounting but you know i kinda figured that wasn't for me so i decided to go into journalism 'cause i i couldn't i mean you know i'd probably still be sitting at a desk but you know at least with journalism i can go out in the field and you know talk to people and you know kinda you know receive information gather information that sorta deal and then you know write up stories i just thought it was you know it was a lot more interesting for me as opposed to you know just kinda crunching numbers all day so yep <laughter> my dream job i would have to say um you know some something in maybe radio broadcasting sports broadcasting um you know i think that would be really interesting something that's definitely a passion of mine so <clears throat> my relationship with my family it's it's pretty good you know i i live with my parents still like i said i'm twenty three years old um you know there's certain times when it can be a little bit shaky little bit rocky but for the most part it's it's pretty good you know i've i've matured a lot in the last few years so things are uh you know getting back up to speed i would say things are things are going pretty well <clears throat> you know i think it stems somewhere kind of in the middle you know sometimes i can be very outgoing and talkative to people when i'm relaxed and laid-back other times i kinda it's not so much like i go into my shell but you know at times like i can be kinda shy if i don't know people as well or if i haven't i've never met them before so it's one of those things that kinda <ki> yeah you kinda gotta meet me in the middle with it because you know i can either be talk very talkative or at times you know i i can be a little bit shy but you know once i once i get the conversation going i'm i'm fairly talkative and so <clears throat> <laughter> um you know usually um i would listen to music or you know maybe just you know kinda go for a drive or uh you know hang out with my friends you know just something to just to kinda you know ease ease that you know 'cause you know like i said sometimes you get a little bit you know tense and you just wanna relax and you know just do the things that you enjoy so <clears throat> you know i've actually been better with that um couple years back you know i there was points where like i pretty much couldn't control my temper like whatsoever like <li> i mean i would just pretty much get angry at you know the littlest things everything would just kinda tick me off but you know i've i've definitely learned to uh you know control that sorta thing and you know it's made me a better person because of it <clears throat> well let's see i'm trying to think it's it was probably something with my family with my mother maybe it's i i can't remember off the top of my head but you know it's it's always something so miniscule that that's why i probably don't remember it but you know eventually we make up and i apologize for it because you know i accept that you know i'm wrong in certain <cer> you know certain circumstances <clears throat> yeah something that i feel guilty about um probably you know not being as nice to others as i could've been in the past you know i mean and that is the past and you know i don't like to dwell on that sorta thing but i think that's one thing that i that i've tried to work on but it's also one thing that i kinda regret not doing just being just being nice <clears throat> hardest decision i ever had to make uh it was pretty recent kinda tough because uh i actually have a buddy he was in the air force and he recently got diagnosed with uh paranoid schizophrenia so that was really tough and it's hard for me to talk to him because you know he's he's not really all there anymore like he used to be so it's one of those things where i feel like i'm kind of ignoring him and i don't wanna do that but at the same time i don't know his tendencies he could be a little you know crazy so probably like you know some sort of like traumatic stress disorder maybe when he was in the military so i don't know but yeah <clears throat> yeah it's pretty tough you know 'cause we go way back been best friends with him <sigh> since i was probably about five six years old so it's just yeah it's just really hard to deal with but you know i i try to i don't i don't  you know try to keep in the back of my mind but you know it's it's always there i don't i don't ever forget so yeah <clears throat> my best friend <laughter> well he'd probably say that you know i'm i'm a pretty pretty down to earth guy usually pretty honest sometimes brutally honest but you know i try to work on that too um he'd probably say that i'm pretty funny um i like to hang out you know just kinda do things here and there you know just normal activities like any other person you know go to the beach hang out watch movies you know grab a few beers that sorta deal so yeah <clears throat you know it varies sometimes it's easier than others you know if i'm really tired you know i'll probably have a very good sleep i haven't been sleeping all that great the last few days 'cause you know my house uh there's workers on the roof so they're you're putting in the new roofing so that's kinda tough so that always wakes me up early in the morning so sometimes a little bit crabby but for the most part i usually get a pretty good sleep <clears throat> lately eh been feeling pretty good you know because you know things are starting to look up i actually got an internship about <bout> a month ago for um you know my field of journalism so that's good about to graduate in two months so i'm looking forward to that um starting to make a little bit more money that's you know that's good and uh yeah things are just going pretty well right now i can't complain <clears throat> yeah it's it's not bad you know like i said it could always be worse right but you know i'm i'm enjoying life so it's the that's the best part <clears throat> i have not no nope no last time i felt really happy <sigh> man <laughter> you know it was probably going back to my buddy when you know he was still still had his sanity i guess you could say um we you know he came back to visit from the air force he had some leave so you know we were just hanging out um you know just kicking back having a few beers and just talking about life so that that was nice but i miss that you know so <clears throat> i felt great you know it because there's nothing like having a best friend you can have conversation you know twenty four seven about anything can tell anything to him in confidence and he could tell me anything in confidence like that's hard to find you know especially someone that you've known for so many years and then you can't really get it back now so yeah <clears throat> yeah there there's a there's probably one or two things that i regret um well i mean i regret <reg> i got a d_u_i about three or four years ago actually it was four years ago so that's something that i definitely regret because you know i look back on it and you know things might've been different but at the same time you have to accept you know the actions you know circumstances that took place so you know i manned up and you know i guess i think i'm better off for it but at the same time you know it's it's always gonna be in the back of my mind like i said it's just one of those things that you have to deal with in your own way <clears throat> <laughter> well you know it's one of those things like <laughter> i was a child then so i i really don't know what to say i mean even if i would've listened then who knows but you know i probably would've told myself you know just be careful you know make sure you can be the best person that you possibly can can be um basically you know just always be nice be honest um just be caring toward others so <clears throat> um probably going back to uh my buddy with the whole uh paranoid schizophrenic thing i don't say that i wish i could erase it i just wish that it didn't happen like that so <clears throat> yeah my ideal weekend uh i usually keep it pretty pretty generic i tend to hang out with my friends um either you know we hang out in the day you know do certain things like you know maybe grab a few beers um you know just have casual conversation maybe play games watch movies you know just the standard stuff that people do so <clears throat> some things that i wish i could change um probably just you know be nicer like i said before um maybe not being as lazy have more determination i mean i i have quite a bit of determination i know what i wanna do with my life but i know there are times when i i kinda get a little lackadaisical so i wish i could improve upon that and not procrastinate as much so <clears throat> um well you know it's it's tough to think back but i would probably say a time when someone made me feel really bad is you know i would say probably like when i was you know kinda getting angry at certain people maybe just kinda chewing out my friends when i probably shouldn't have i was trying to give more constructive criticism but at the same time i knew it it was probably not my place to say those kinds of things and they were out of character so <clears throat> my best qualities i would say that i'm definitely hardworking i'm determined i'm very caring now more than i used to be very honest and you know i i just i love to talk to people like i like making new relationships i like making people laugh <clears throat> <clears throat> something that i did recently that i really enjoyed um you know it was probably <sigh> over at my internship i was just you know i i wrote a story or two and it just felt good you know to get those stories done and eventually they're gonna go into the paper so i feel accomplished about that you know it's one of those things when you work at something and then you see the product right there you know it's right in your face and you can tell yourself you know like i did that so makes me feel good yep <clears throat> um you know just let's see eh few different stories eh just usually things about well the the paper's in long beach so it's usually about you know stories or events that are taking place in long beach so yeah <clears throat> i would say that i'm most proud of you know graduating high school about to graduate college hopefully you know obviously i'm gonna earn a degree and then hopefully get a you know a good solid job you know in the near future i think that's one thing that i'm most proud of <clears throat> thank you,0
380,<synch> sure i'm fine i'm doing alright um yeah i'm from maryland yeah from maryland washington d_c area uh like five weeks ago <laughter> <laughter> maryland um <deep breath> it's a lot it's a lot less um uh xxx it's a uh it's not as nice this time of year it's more um uh it's it's good it's nice it's um l_a's a lot better though it's a lot it's a lot more people lot more going on um i'm still <st> i guess i'm still getting used to it so um it's it's not like um yeah i'm still getiing used to it it's it's coming slowly but but surely i live in culver city i do i have one uh it's okay it's i live in a really nasty house it's uh it's cheap <chea> it's cheap 'cause i'm living in a friend's place um and uh but but and he's letting me stay there for half price but the the actual like place itself is pretty horrible <horr> horrible living conditions <laughter> but i'm moving soon so i can't see your shoes actually uh but no i i travel xxx i would say i xxx i've probably traveled more than most people in the u_s like considering that most people don't travel in the u_s but i wouldn't i wouldn't call myself a world traveler or anything i enjoy the chance to get to like see other um walks of life and and and kind of like meditate on the the specificity of my own you know the the the the <th> given the parameters that i grew up under like how different everyone else is like how how every life is totally um i mean even just within the u_s like seeing how someone in california grows up is so different from how someone in maryland grows up and then to think about someone in like thailand or something growing up it's pretty it's pretty amazing mhm uh okay um hmm putting me on the spot here ellie um let's see uh well um i it's been awhile since i've been on a trip i guess one of the last trips i did was to um i mean it a xxx like two years ago i went on road trip across the u_s and that was that was pretty amazing saw but i guess the best place <pl> the best two places on the road <roa> i drove from maryland to l_a this is before i actually moved out here but um i i visited new orleans and new orleans was just this whole like even though it's part of the u_s it's like a totally it's totally different than anywhere else it's so um unique the culture there is so unique and and the blend of like caribbean and french and all these other influences into like the american south is so so um uh incredible <incred> eh yeah it's just it's it's unreal <un> yeah it's unreal hmm it's a tough question um one <on> um <makes clicking sound with mouth> i uh hmm you know i i i you can you come back to that question are you capable of that yeah come back to it yeah that's what i just said film you know that's actually a question i've been asking myself i knew <kne> i know i my entire life i've had like phases of interest so when i was like very very very young i was really into like the first phase that i remember was keys and then tools like i would go around collecting keys and then i'd go around collecting tool like just every sort of tool i had a toolbox my parents have told me that i had a phase before that with which was balls like various balls um and then i was really into like insects collecting insects and reptiles and and stuff <stu> and like animals and then it was a dinosaur phase and at a certain <cert> and eh at a certain point i got really into um like rap <ra> like music like first <fi> at first rap and then uh guitar and then acting and then at some point in there i i had told <to> i rememeber telling someone that right now i'm interested in playwriting and and poetry but eventually i was going to be interested in in uh film like i i could kinda see the trajectory coming but i don't remember what led me to that conclusion i think i just always i was <wa> led a sheltered life uh as far as movies are concerned i didn't my parents didn't let me see an r-rated movie until i was like in high school almost like um and uh and i never uh so i never saw an r-rated movie i was also very squeamish like i remember when i was fairly young maybe like six i saw star wars the first scene in darth <dar> star wars darth vader crack like breaks a guy's neck and so just a little scene very at the very very beginning and that like freaked me out and i had to leave the room so i'm not really sure uh yeah it's it's it's um i don't i'm not exactly sure how i got into film but uh i've always been fascinated by like how people interact and what like you know acting and stuff so and movies in general i am yes um to be a filmmaker to be able to direct and uh put <pu> put together and make <ma> like i guess direct i don't mm use that word so much 'cause it i think i think of it more as like i i want the opportunity to put together and make movies uh or to make movies is probably the best way to do it uh to say it 'cause i want you know i want involvement in all the all the processes but i guess the best parabole for that would be a director directing well it's a lot better when i'm not living with them um my i guess um it's funny you should ask ellie um i've been thinking about it a lot lately i i think i'm close in my entire family i'm closest with my dad um i get along with my brother and sister you know like but i don't when away like my brother's in a foreign country right now so i don't have the opportunity to talk with him but like i spend more time talking to my dad than anyone else 'cause i feel like he's the most like of all my family he's the one who most accepts me and like um thinks positively about me um so it's i have like a a complicated relationship with my parents i mean <mea> and my family in general well on the myers uh briggs personality test i'm uh i'm an extrovert but lately <late> like since moving but i'm not like um i'm not i probably would consider myself on the scheme of extroversion uh or on the scale of extroversion sorry um i would consider myself extremely introverted um i just i see other extroverts and just no matter who they're around they're able to like strike up conversations and i'm i'm a fairly shy person i'm sort of like uh or inhibited person maybe um so i like to like until yeah i'm but i'm working on it i'm working on it um well in the past i would smoke weed but i've quit smoking weed so now i you know i have a glass of wine and maybe watch a movie um i don't have or maybe go like depending if it's like an xxx if it's um if it's a worn out sort of stress like i'm just like then i that's what i do but if it's a more like anxious type stress i might go on a uh an intense walk don't really exercise that much but i like you know competitive sports and hiking pretty good well i always like arguing um i wouldn't call arguing necessarily losing my temper um i i enjoy uh a vicious debate um but i don't as long as my like 'cause i won't like revert to personal you know attacks uh in my in my arguments i try to keep it on subject um and try to explain myself as best i can which can get frustrating 'cause i'm not like the best articulator of what i think um one of my weaker points i would say but um but the last time i had a a heated debate i think that was was that the question um what happened i forget i forget the question that that i had a heated debate hmm the last time i had a heated debate was um i had a heated debate about uh the movie boogie nights um i was <wa> i i didn't lose my temper exactly but i get like very extremely passionate about about 'cause i i don't think it's like that good of a movie but the two people who i was i was arguing with were saying that it was like one of the like best um best movies <laughter> why did they think it was the best movie um they think that like there's some there's some sort of they'll as i understand it they have um they have a certain uh they think that the like all of the stories within boogie nights they have their own um like each of them could be their own separate stories they just think that there's a whole like complexity of character within the movie and um that somehow like <sigh> um what what were they saying they were saying like the movie it like xxx it's like the end of an era which makes it like kinda like casino and there's this attention to detail of of of the in the different character like how they how they interact in the plot um kind of like uh yeah i guess i think the heated debate became about like then so from there and uh like personally i it's not like a bad movie or anything but it's the um i just don't think dirk diggler is like that like meaningful <mean> meaningful of a character like i i guess the way i come out i came out of the movie 'cause i had seen it before many years ago and eh i my opinion of it is basically the same even though like i remember like in watching it again i was able to reevaluate it um there's nothing bad about the movie there's nothing articulable <art> like articulable about that's it's like solid <so> good solid acting you know the directing is good the camera moves are cool um the eh it really <rea> you know it's cool it's but but it's meaningless <mea> for me it was like meaningless and then to and then there were that led us to discuss 'cause a movie that i saw recently that i really did like was django unchained and they both saw that movie and they hated that movie and then there was this extreme i guess the heated part of the conversation came about like so in the movie django unchained um you have django and django is like a kinda he's a two dimensional character but i don't think that that necessarily takes away from what the the big the big purpose of the movie is and um and you have doctor king schultz who's this uh who's this like his mentor character and the person i was arguing with was saying that he was intelligent and uh so and because he was intelligent there's no way he would've risked his life to save django or like would've gone into this like second act where they go and they go to this uh uh plantation to to save django's wife etcetera and um and the reason <rea> the the reason for her giving that argument which like either you buy that he would do that or he wouldn't but the reason for her argument is that an intelligent person would not sacrifice themself for someone else um which strikes <stri> which strikes me as so like um like who uh like she she her basic <ba> her basic argument was that altruism <al> like altruism doesn't exist <exi> it was a very ayn rand type argument altruism doesn't exist um the only the only thing you can do is serve <ser> like the only thing people do is serve themself um so it's not quite ayn rand but it's like the only people <peo> thing that people <peo> like all people are out to serve themself which i'm not arguing that like every decision has like a mix of altruism and and so like even the most altruistic type decision there's maybe like kernels of self self-interest in there but she made it sound like self-interest was the only motivating factor in and and like what but what how how horrible is your life if that's like what your ultimate um purpose <pur> like if you if you can't like love and sacrifice for other people so it led into an extremely uh passionate debate um and uh somewhat like yeah and it's it uh so um so yeah that that i guess that's the the i don't think i necessarily like lost my temper um i think of losing my temper as being more um like i just so <s> i i would so <s> revert to um ad hominem like attacks uh but i i didn't like that's not um maybe i was like maybe i was criticizing <crit> like criticizing her world view but it i wasn't like well you're an idiot you know like it wasn't it didn't it didn't turn into abuse of any sort yeah i'm glad you understand <deep breath> an event or a i don't know if i necessarily would want to erase anything from my memory i would say an issue that i have is not being able to remember in as much detail as i would like i remember feelings and moments not stories um like my life doesn't sync <s> always sync together into like a coherent story it's like this moment and that moment and this moment and that moment so yeah the hardest decision i've ever had to make oh geez could it just be one of the hardest decisions hmm um like choosing between two things that it's like i guess i i'm having a hard time recalling a moment where i like had to choose between two options like no there's no like sophie's choice type moment in my life but i but i do think that the decision 'cause i lived in new york for a while i went to school in new york and uh the decision to leave new york after having lived there for five years was a was very very difficult um and uh but i had to do it for money reasons and because all of my all of my core group of friends were either like leaving <lea> were most of them were leaving and going other places in the world and then uh the one other person who i was close to was living with someone who i did not get along with at all so it was like this situation where i didn't i was either gonna live with people who i wasn't as close with or craigslist or or move home and i i think it was a tough decision to to leave i i had <ha> in fact it was so tough that the only way i could do it i had to justify it by saying that i would be moving back to new york within like a month or two uh which wasn't which didn't end up happening but that was the only way that i could leave new york it was how hard was that or how hard is how hard was that um it was hard <laughter> um it was it was yeah it was it was just a very like isolating isolating <is> 'cause also like i'd fallen <fa> like previously to that time i had fallen in love with one of my like closest another one of my close very close friends and uh that had kind of gone extremely badly and so i wasn't on speaking terms with her and i couldn't like that whole everyone on my list of friends who was like more <mo> closer to xxx her it was wasn't quite like her or me type thing but that that was the way that i kind of saw it at the time so i didn't like you know just being socially isolated etcetera yeah well recently it's been awful um i uh i like two so the last last night i slept for like ten and a half hours um which seems to be the length of time that i have to sleep in order to have really vivid dreams but previous to that night so last not last night but the night before last and the night before that i got four hours and two hours of sleep um because i was working on set and i would get back and either and i just like couldn't fall asleep for whatever reason it's um too much riled up energy or something i i don't know tired uh very not immediately i guess initially upon waking up like i really enjoy being up in the early morning and um i also stopped drinking caffeine like i i've had like a little bit of coffee the last two days but before the last two days i hadn't had any coffee in like three and a half weeks so um i guess with with caffeine in my system i'm ready to i'm ready to go um without caffeine it's i'm just i'm just quieter i guess more introverted since like lately as in when um change in my thoughts yeah i mean i guess when having just moved here there was a period of time like eh at the beginning where the the sheer difficulty of finding a job and finding people to xxx 'cause i moved here 'cause i have a group of friends here or couple of friends but i don't have like a a large number of friends and the the push to to get out there and meet people and find a job and that sort of pressure was pretty um overwhelming at first and i think that i'm slowly like coming to terms with that um and moving you know moving past it i i but not necessarily <nece> you know like it's still it's still there the pressure's there but i'm just you know you you know <sigh> you know <sigh> no i just nope the last time i felt really happy might have to reach back um i think the last time i felt really happy was uh during the writing process of so last year i shot a movie um co-wrote co-directed co-produced um and that was kinda like that it still consumes my life but um but i i i think during the writing stages of that movie in which we would bunker <bunk> like get up eat breakfast bunker down work really hard put stuff up on the thing just like pure creative full <fu> energy um between <betw> between me and the person writing it and and there's like probably like a xxx a day that i remember where it's just i remember going to bed and i was just so thrilled to be working on what i was working on and and and working with the person i was working with and like just like i felt like it yeah i guess that was the the last time that was that was like eh more than a year ago though but i guess it's hard to hard to think that i haven't been really truly happy since then but when you're making a movie like you don't you can't allow yourself to be happy really <real> especially if you're doing it you know basically by yourself with <wi> with like xxx like can't it's too much else to do so i would say that i'm very accepting <acce> like accepting of other people and always eh i'm very empathic <em> empathic <em> empathic um and open <o> open <ope> like excited about new ideas and open to new ideas and yeah um hmm um i guess i wish i was less uh uh less ruled by fear more fearless <f> more fearless in my you know everyday interactions and in my like um you know zest for for living um <sigh> yeah i xxx i other things i would change about myself i'd i would i don't know <laughter> hmm really badly about myself um <sigh> i think there are numerous <nu> numerous instances in my childhood in which my like uh like every single time there was an issue at school or some sort of um some sort of uh conflict with a teacher or anything my parents were always always on the other side of the court you know like never it was i i noticed or noticed as i got older that other people other parents were like if their kid was in trouble like there was something wrong with with like their kid was perfect there's something wrong with other people but my parents were it was always the opposite um in particular my mom so i would say that there a couple of instances in which um i was like blamed or like you know it was my it was my fault um when when what i was doing like yeah it's just thing things things that i couldn't like there's no yeah i don't know yeah ten years ago um stay stake you know like i i think that there's um i have a tendency to like i love <lo> love the fact that i have a tendency to get really caught up in ideas <ide> in an idea and like devote myself entirely to it but sometimes um ideas are too easily xxx i would just say like do as much as possible like don't don't decide that you um are only going to do one thing um try to like i guess i would've taken up like some done <do> taken piano learn learn to read music would be a big thing for me learn to play the drums would've been drums more than reading music i would say i'd love to learn how to play the drums and maybe done more like acting classes um as far as like 'cause i was always really into directing so i was always directing actors and stuff but i didn't it's only now that i um i don't know i guess stay uh don't stay <sta> stay stay focused <fo> yeah i don't know that's a tough tough question <que> tough question ellie that's it sure goodbye bye,1
381,<synch> yes okay from santa monica uh the people mostly <sigh> well the people also <laughter> <laughter> uh no not a lot well i can't afford to travel as much as i'd like to mm i was an english major uh i just liked reading a lot at the time so it sounded like the best thing well the most fun thing to study no not anymore oh i guess my dream job would be to manage a uh soccer club oh it'd be pretty much impossible for me um i don't have any experience <laughter> in that field i'm very shy i play music <sigh> what do i do when i'm annoyed i don't know um what do i do when i'm annoyed i can't think of anything i don't know i don't think yeah i don't do anything specifically uh pretty good i would say very good i don't lose my temper very often mm when was the last time i argued with someone <sigh> i can't remember uh yeah i don't have a lot of conflicts with people i can't remember the last time i argued with someone <sigh> well let's see when i was um a little kid i was outside my grandparents' uh restaurant and there was a robbery and i saw it i well i saw it when when the robbers were leaving um yeah maybe i would want to erase that from my memory if i could well i didn't know what was happening in that moment so i didn't feel so bad at the time but i felt bad afterward because then um you know my mother was upset by it my mother was there and she had to call the police and it was it was disturbing to see her you know really disturbed that way but at the time that it actually happened i wasn't really upset it was more the the aftermath of it mm it was <wa> it was <laughter> <sigh> situation that <sniffle> <sigh> i don't know um well i can think of um there's probably a million situations that i would've <laughter> i wish i would've handled differently i can't think of one in particular um maybe i think that when i was a kid i um well i think that when i was let's see well i have okay i have a good one um i didn't marry the girl that i think that i should have married so that's a big one for me yeah well we <w> we were together for about four years and uh i think i just took her for granted and i just didn't uh commit and um that was a long time ago and now that's it's been so many years i realize well i don't know that if it's a realization but i think now that that yeah she should've been my wife that we were meant for each other or made for each other but because my selfishness and because i just uh had this fear of commitment at the time i just felt like i didn't uh i didn't do what i should've done what what the smart thing would've been <sigh> well the last thing i can think of that i would say i feel guilty about was <sigh> no i feel a lot of guilt about my my friendships i've not i don't feel like i'm as as good of a friend as i could be but then at the same time i don't really know exactly what uh how i could be a better friend i just feel a little guilty that i'm not that i can't help people anyone who who has a problem i can't i never feel like i can help anyone who i know who has a problem so oh that happens every day i guess it that happens with everyone who i know and everyone all of my relatives and all of my friends i don't feel like i can really give them anything or help them in their lives you know well they're um it's very distant it's it's just it's very cordial and it's very uh uh i don't know what the word is it's on the it's kept at a very surface level i don't think that they know i don't think that my family really knows me very well at all and uh i don't know them very well either not not in a not in a true sense so yeah it's it's i think a lot of families are that way but it it is it does bother me that mine is that way oh it's very easy i sleep a lot and i um yeah i i i have no problem sleeping at all no not not really i would say they way i am now it's the way i think i've been my whole life so even when i was a little kid i slept a lot also and no i don't think i've i've changed much mm pretty down but like i said in a way i could say yeah i'm feeling really down but then again i've always been this way so it's hard to say that's it's down when it's consistently that way yes a long oh a long time ago i was um about ten years old or around there about uh i was just missing a lot of school i didn't wanna go to school so eventually uh they sent me to to a therapist and then to a psychologist and then to a psychiatrist and uh it went from there no i haven't gone to therapy since i was a teenager well i didn't feel it was helping me at all so one day i just decided i didn't wanna go anymore eh uh well like i said it i didn't feel that it helped me um so i guess it i don't know that it affected me much no i wouldn't say disturbing no mm well i feel pretty happy whenever i see my nephew and uh i have a my best friend's children are i feel like they're my my nephew and my niece and i'm pretty happy when i'm around them uh my ideal weekend would be um i would travel <tr> i would probably be traveling i i would really enjoy just getting out of the city every weekend um eh going anywhere really just anywhere out of the city uh just seeing the way different people live and how people are different wherever you go i really do think people are different when you go to different places and how they interact with you and how they see the world different food um and i also like historical places i i'm into history and i and i enjoy um just visiting anywhere that has some sort of a historical significance <laughter> oh i haven't taken a trip in a long time um the last trip i really took was i went to france a few years ago for a wedding and i had a really good time there and i had always wanted to go to paris and so i got to go to paris and then i went to a little town um that's a few hours away from paris where the actual wedding was and yeah it was really fun i think the the church where the wedding was was uh like a thousand years old so yeah it was a really cool trip <sigh> <sigh> like i don't know i don't <laughter> i don't know what's what would would be considered memorable uh a memorable experience probably the most memorable experience i guess would just be nothing in particular but but living with the girl who i just who i told you earlier that i think now that we should've gotten married um that's something that stays in my memory that's why i'm saying it's memorable because it's it's still with me and um eh it's something that i don't think you know well i'll know i'll never forget it but it's not any mm particular day or any particular moment you know oh a lot um wish i could be healthier for one thing uh more energetic and um more friendly well no i think i am pretty friendly but more uh more outgoing more social <s> more uh more social um those two things mainly i guess i would like to be more more social more enthusiastic and more and healthier oh that's a good question my best friend how would my best friend describe me i think i think he would say that i'm a very <sigh> well it sounds cheesy but it <laughter> he would probably say that i'm a very spiritual person and that i'm very giving i i think i'm a lot more selfish than people think i am but people think that i'm not selfish um and probably he would say that i'm creative also <sigh> wow well my advice to to myself i don't understand the question <laughter> yeah but we already talked about it <sigh> nah i can't uh well i don't think that i really believe in in being proud or in in pride um i don't think that it accomplishments are really something to be proud of but i can't really think of any accomplishment anyway even if i did have something <laughter> to be proud of no i can't think of anything <anythi> any sort of accomplishment i've had <sigh> uh something i did recently that i really enjoyed well i sang karaoke with a couple of friends of mine <laughter> and i don't usually do that but yeah i had a that was a lot of fun a few days ago thank you nan nan nan nan,1
382,<synch> sure i'm doing fine i'm from columbia south carolina yep uh two thousand four yeah <laughter> uh once a year for christmas break uh a lot slower paced more xxx i wanted to perform <perf> to pursue a film degree or i'm sorry a film career yes it's pretty challenging but it's uh fun uh i've always had a interest <inter> interest in uh film and movies so uh it seemed like a natural pick for me uh took about a couple of years but uh i feel like i'm pretty used to it now uh i like that uh it doesn't snow it's warm weather and there's lots do to with a lot of beaches uh the traffic and the cost of living is pretty high <laughter> i've never been outside of the u_s but uh i would love to at some point uh it depends on the situation i i can either be introverted or extroverted just given uh the right circumstance i like uh listening to music uh doing crossword puzzles reading and hanging out with friends on weekends uh very good hmm uh i don't think it was argument maybe <may> maybe a difference of opinion so it was more like a debate but uh it was pretty pretty tame uh i think it was a debate over sports over a basketball <ba> a basketball game and uh i was talking on facebook with somebody about it but i think it's good to uh express yourself if you have a difference of opinion it's uh it's natural to you know not always agree on things so i think talking <ta> talking about is healthy <hea> is healthy i have a very good relationship with my family um i get along with all of my family members and extended you know cousins and aunts and uncles so uh there's no one that i i've ever had any rifts with hmm with my family hmm i probably could've been more disciplined growing up and more uh more disciplined with schoolwork and homework that kinda thing but for the most part uh i had a i had a good childhood and uh there's not much i would change about it hmm probably leaving my comfort zone in uh south carolina moving out here that was pretty hard but at the same time it was uh exciting so it was it was a bittersweet feeling um a lot of excitement mixed with uh some anxiety but it uh it went away pretty quickly sure not doing better in school uh when i was in high school uh definitely i could've been a a <ss> um more diligent worker and i could've uh applied myself a little bit better hmm i've always had a strong support <s> uh family support system and uh parents and uh siblings so that's definitely a positive thing hmm an event uh probably going back to school i wish i would've uh wish i would've done better in school so if i could take something back from my past it would be uh scholastically <sch> scholastically related it's pretty easy when i don't sleep well um i tend to be kinda lackadaisical and uh just tired throughout the day kinda groggy uh no everything's pretty much uh the way it usually is with me i've been feeling pretty good uh no i have not uh no i haven't last time i felt really happy um i made a lot of money uh a few weeks ago and uh i feel like i'm ahead of the game with you know with having rent under control and a lot of bills out here so i'm still kinda have the lingering effects from that happiness yeah uh when i when i have money i tend to be a lot uh more even-tempered not even-tempered but i tend to feel better about things and more optimistic and this city being such about your finances it it always makes you feel good to be ahead of the game and to have uh xxx have sources of income uh i think i'm creative and i think i'm a good listener hmm to be as disciplined and focused as possible because once you're out of your parents' homes and out of their lives you have to depend on yourself and the better the better you do in school and the better you are um uh as far as discipline's concerned the more pleasurable <pleasur> pleasurable your life will be and a lot eh uh your life will be a lot easier hmm let's see here i wish i was more disciplined but i'm working on that and i've gotten a lot better at that it's become pretty easy i think i'm just getting older um i'm out of my twenties now so i definitely seen a change from when i first came out here hmm um some people tend to say that my decision to move out here was uh not feasible and kind of a pipe dream so that kinda made me feel bad but uh i kinda take insults in stride and um sometimes i welcome constructive criticism 'cause some some things are wrong with you that you're not aware of so as long as it's not mean-spirited and it's coming from the right place i think it could be an invaluable uh tool you know listening to what to what other people have to say that might be negative hmm uh probably optimistic and um outgoing optimistic and uh helpful my ideal weekend uh i would love to go to vegas and have a road trip with with three or four friends you know packed in the car and just uh lots of disposable income and um you know good weather uh i haven't been to vegas in probably five years but um i've gone to casinos with my brother and that's pretty fun sometimes uh i'm proud that i've come a long way from when i first moved out here i'm uh a lot more disciplined um i read a lot uh i do crosswords and i think i've i think i know what's important in life now and i'm more focused and going after what i want hmm i'm not a big fan of high taxes um but it doesn't really make me mad it makes me frustrated and and uh i guess i take it in stride though uh i had a friend over at my apartment and i watched a movie and that was fun it was a documentary a sport <s> a sports sure goodbye,0
383,<sync> yeah i'm totally fine it be confidential or not you know my words <wo> my words are everybody's get wild <laughter> i'm doing pretty good hanging out nice weather um i just had a recent change of feeling just now looking at you <laughter> the the digitial you that i'm saying uh i don't know it's yeah it's funny um <tisk> because i just always thought that uh the conveying of emotions or feelings uh  be like better understood with a human interaction as opposed to a non human entity such as yourself yeah i i think you see what i mean <laughter> i'm from um born and raised in los angeles venice area mar vista specifically um that's where i'm from um well  there's a lot more that i don't like but what i do like is  that public transportation is coming up uh  that the idea of  certain you know medical drugs like marijuana is a prevalent you know topic very  thought upon and i feel that los angeles' deep culture is um why i stay here and pursue my art because there's a lot to there's a lot to gain from the different communities if you understand <laughter> yeah um well the the human mentality here is um is very very hectic very chaotic you know a lot due to the vehicle the car the freeway and this idea that we're on a grind you know this yeah it's it's a very it's it's very hectic um atmosphere human atmosphere that is not very conducive for a supporting loving community to help each other out kind of thing yeah well i can't see your shoes <laughter> but um i love to travel i do love hiking i do love surfing swimming biking riding taking rides uh <laughter> i do love to travel yeah um from my travels it's not like well i do enjoy a lot of things about travel but it's more like what do i it's it's just more like i i enjoy not being uh trapped in the city with all these uh made up ties and restraints i enjoy traveling because i get to see the world as it really is instead of this uh faux image you know man <ma> man made image that it is here so i love traveling because i get to get out of this and see the world as it is thanks <laughter> would you <laughter> okay <laughter> um well i um kind of recently last year went to los banos central california area and although it wasn't that far from l_a it was completely different energy um there was no phones  there was no wifi there's no t_v there was um there was sanity there was a relative sanity  in the sense that um people weren't diluted and getting all of this input from digital media and  outer influence people were just raw real and hiking and chilling I was working at a hot spring resort and i just got to breath and hike and farm and do a lot of carpentry yeah um not hard you don't you don't even think about difficulty when you're doing things you truly love and enjoy so it wasn't um i guess uh kind of what i described about the city i just wanted to uh get out of here and kind of kind of just get out of here really and just experience the real the real deal yeah um well currently i'm studying um currently i'm studying physical therapy i'm about to become a licensed massage therapist but before that yeah kind of cool but before that i was going to scrubbed_entry  um for music composition so i was just writing scores for  films animations dance productions theater productions stuff like that yeah it was it was cool it was fun trippy  very trippy um but it was cool but i had to leave that because  tuition hikes up to you know going up to like fifty thousand a year for like a four year b_f_a is uh not not the deal not trying to  trap myself with these uh chains of federal loans so yeah hey that's not a good word sucks <laughter> um dream job hm my dream job would be anything <exhale> that i can do to alleviate these uh metropolitan like cities from the nightmare that they've been put in my dream is to alleviate the nightmare my dream is to incite dream back within the modern human world and with you know physical therapy and artistic expression i've got some great ideas <laughter> yeah um i guess more outgoing i just like i just like experiencing things so outgoing yeah    <laughter> i thought that was really funny um what i do to relax is uh just kind of breath it out chill maybe make a smoothie or some tea and i go bike riding write yeah hmm pretty good i guess i haven't yelled in a long time um well it wasn't arguing i don't i don't really argue much i just like to state my opinion  and have it be understood and i like the person that i'm conversing with to say their opinion and have it understood so the last time that happened was uh i guess yesterday chilling in downtown with a friend from new york and we were talking about writing and basically we were not arguing but talking about opinions and that sometimes things are not ready to be written yeah so yesterday hm guilty that's tough i haven't had that feeling in a long time guilt what about you what's something you feel guilty about <laughter> okay mm i don't really wish i could erase anything from my memory 'cause then that would just be like i would feel something was lacking from my current present life if something just got erased you know butterfly effect kind of like yeah hmm um maybe the time scrubbed_entry um she was going to school i was taking the year off and i was just kind of hanging around um but we had an apartment together with another friend and it didn't turn out you know not all nothing turns out as it's thought to be and that's kind of the beautiful thing about it but this one turned out a little uh a little different actually quite different than i thought it would be and i thought it was funny but yeah it ended up uh me leaving before the lease ended and that actually ended up yeah with us separating but that's something i wish uh maybe i handled a little more thoughtfully the hardest decision huh hm maybe maybe not the hardest but a hard decision i had to make was leaving school dropping my uh continuation of achieving being a b_f_a yeah that could've been the hardest um it's just uh i don't i mean of course money money is the motto money's a big issue tution hikes going around the whole nation not a fan of that not a fan of support <s> not a fan of support that but um yeah that's probably one of the biggest reasons why i just don't support these crazy tution hikes going around and um but another reason why i decided to leave i had to make a hard decision to decide to leave was  also because um art institute you know um that's a that's a funny idea in itself already and basically i was a musician being taught by a musician to make music and same with you know all the all the dancers or the theatre students you know getting taught dance to to a dancer from a dancer how to dance you know and it's just um yeah it's just not quite as artistic as i thought art would be art <shh> art comes from somewhere uh somewhere sweet and deep and purple and uh not not from out there you know so yeah hm if i if i um it's kind of easy i mean it depends you know if i remember to make some chamomile tea or if i remember to breathe and go through my mantras or remember to do my pre like dream therapy work then i can get into it real nice um but if i just get deluded with all my thought then it takes a long time until i remember to breathe yeah um yeah basically just what i said just breathing or you know if i'm hanging out with friends coming home late and if i get the lucky chance to be uh medicated from you know a nice a nice indica um then it really does you know indica does put me down pretty nice pretty drowsy so a lot of things breathing you know mm you know medical herbs uh like chamomile and cannabis and just uh going just relieving myself of bad bad juju <laughter> mm mm i i guess not if i can't think of something no i've been feeling kind of like kind of like this kind of just cruising on a on a grey line but it's a nice grey it's a really nice hue um some people wouldn't like this but i really like that and it's uh it's stable yeah it's it's comfortable yeah no no i haven't not by a certified um medical professional no but no i haven't <laughter> um yeah i mean i just think like the whole you know like you said p_t_s_d depression and you know other you know mental instabilities i think everybody is depressed i think everybody is overjoyed i think everybody's angry i think everybody's shy everybody's social all at the same time you know it's just different days different you know variants different floats different boats you know different waves different swells um so yeah i think i'm depressed i think i'm really happy i think i'm really angry i think i'm really friendly you know all that but just on different variants different floats really happy um i i mean i feel really happy a lot uh and i feel really sad a lot but really happy was uh i guess maybe this morning when i just biking over here just enjoying the sun enjoying the breeze biking yeah it is <laughter> um well i have a lot of best friends and they describe me all all pretty differently but underlying that same idea that maybe i'm just uh maybe in a nutshell just kind of aquarius i guess well i'm twenty one so twenty years ago <laughter> i would've told myself to keep being a baby uh stay young and don't lose sight you know don't stop listening keep letting things happen don't make them happen be be a beautiful baby that's what i would've told myself or yeah be a beautiful baby mm um well i guess recently what has been shown to me uh through me by me is um my ability to work with others and i'm mainly speaking in an artistic standpoint i've been uh collaborating a lot with artists working on a lot of different um mediums mixed media projects and i'm really comfortable with it and with other peoples and melting our ideas together yeah mm that's a weird question like um like that's trying to make me single out the you know one moment that i today reflect upon and think about like it's some past glory that i'm not capable of fulfilling today so i think the proudest moment of my life is right now chiling hanging with you yeah thank you mm it's interesting um  my immediate family is uh mother father younger sister older brother older brother is in south asia just kind of backpacking around uh younger sis she's really chill she kind of does music too and we just hang out we're really cool mom mama i'm really chill with love her to death uh she gets me and dad uh he he doesn't get me but i love the art that he makes he he does crazy painting and i kind of get him through that but uh uh yeah there needs to be more communication which is being worked upon hm cool yeah thanks for wondering about my thoughts goodbye so i guess i push this guy oh so i could still talk to you <laughter> or i could push this button but this is kind of fun <laughter> and you can laught you should laugh one more time <laughter> can you do other things than laugh,0
385,<sync> yes good how are you los angeles uh weather entertainment traffic no too <t> too many people business uh just fun thing to do yes nothing much to talk about hm maybe talking to you um pretty good environment pretty good the middle sleep i don't know don't remember no nothing really um i don't know i can't remember um bad people you know just bad people doing back things uh car accidents mm don't don't know any of them don't really know any uh nobody no no somewhat okay just waking up thinking no i i don't know no i don't know hm don't don't remember i i don't know talking to you first time i've done this before i have no idea sleep not too much nothing don't have any experience um i don't know not sure um just be a nice person not sure nothing much no i don't know i don't know i don't know play sports basketball mm last month goodbye,0
386,<synch> yes oh um fine a little tired but uh i found out my thyroid is i think acting up so <laughter> i was born in canada and but i've lived in california most of my life so and it's grey today too so the grey weather makes you kinda um you know sluggish the <laughter> oh my gosh years and years ago uh not at all i don't think i've gone back there <laughter> for a long time well the airfares have gone up quite a bit in the last few years gas prices have gone up so travel as much as it's a fun thing to do it's cost prohibitive so uh huh oh let's see everything has plus and minuses um cold weather <laughter> not as much sun so i think i'd prefer getting more sun and having the warm weather so but other than that it's um it's very pretty back there natural scenery and but uh i like it here and you know the traffic's kind of heavy but that's a small thing to deal with so mhm why did i move to l_a because my family came here and started uh my dad got a job here and this became our home base and uh that's why easy very easy so uh huh uh well in high school you generally study general ed yeah it's they have designated courses and then after that went to college and i was a business major let's see i was a veterinary major <laughter> and uh i graduated with a degree in liberal arts so um i don't know can't really pinpoint why <laughter> so i was working in social services but i've also worked in sales and most recently i'm doing real estate i'm a leasing consultant part time i mean everything has plus and minuses it's it's okay it's not i don't really see too many negatives oh probably to work as a uh gossip columnist at t_m_z or one of those networks <laughter> but as you know everything in the entertainment business is very competitive it's who you know so but that would be my dream job or probably working with uh cats you know animals so i'm very outgoing in fact i think i'm so outgoing i scare people sometimes there's a lot of quiet you know reserved people out there so i'm kinda east coast very you know i go up to people and talk to them very social <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> oh my gosh there's i could do hundreds of things i could read i could watch a show turn on the music music is great um take a walk uh call my friends million things <laughter> so i'm pretty good i'm very good i mean you know of course when you're driving in l_a and somebody cuts in front of you sometimes that can be irritating but i'm i'm actually pretty i'm not the type of person that will fight or get i don't like to have confrontations so mhm mm i can't really remember so as i said there's not very many arguments usually i avoid arguments at any cost <sigh> so i don't really feel guilty about anything <laughter> right now or that i can think of mm i can't think of anything right now i really can't think i of any decisions that were really hard i mean most it's pretty easy for make me to make a decision so i don't have a family so if i have to you know i had to move san <s>  to san francisco for a job once but since i'm single it's i don't really have to consider other people and children and that type of thing so it kinda makes certain things easier when you don't have a family to consider mm yeah an event hmm well obviously you don't you know the passing of a family member you know you wish everybody could be around forever so i know when my father died you know i mean i wish i would've had him for a lot longer i mean he died at the age of seventy seven and you know would've been nice to have him around a little bit more but you know can't control those things life has it's own way of dealing with that so mhm yes there are <laughter> yin and yang that's ancient uh philosophy and it really applies there's pluses an minuses and negatives and positives so well as i said my dad's no longer here and my mother and i you know we have our differences i think mothers and daughters always do um my brother and i get along great i see him a lot i see <s> my sister works a lot i see her and you know we talk and she's kinda got her own life and her children i get along great with them so mhm we have a small family uh <laughter> once again it's like that's a hard question to answer there's so many types of kids out there i think majority of them seem to be pretty well-behaved i mean you know there's always gonna be children that are kinda out of control but um i don't know the ones that i've seen recently they're very well-behaved so can't say much else about that well <laughter> i live in an apartment <laughter> and i don't know if you've ever lived in apartment but um uh there's someone that lives above me i'm on the first floor and there's somebody on the second floor and they're pretty quiet but they have a habit of <laughter> i guess they have lots of energy um they usually will take their showers around midnight and sometimes they'll start washing laundry at midnight and of course the pipes run through the bedroom wall <laughter> so <laughter> so it sounds like niagara falls in there and uh so i don't yeah and i need eight hours of sleep and i've only been getting ooh i'd say like maybe six hours and then i usually wake up once at night too 'cause sometimes they'll kind of around two or three in the morning they'll either walk around or i'll hear something so i'm not getting a straight eight hours of sleep and it's definitely <laughter> but there's not like i said there's things you can't control when you live in an apartment you know i mean the the lady's uh very quiet it's just that she has a habit of you know taking later showers <laughter> washing clothes at night that's i can't say anything to her about that so yeah but you know there's people that are in worse situations so i don't make a lot out of it you know and i just it's not like every night but it's you know at least twice a week so i you know i have to consider maybe sleeping <laughter> in another room but for now you know that's i'll deal with it so tired <laughter> very tired and hard to focus hard to concentrate it just takes me longer to get things done 'cause i don't have my energy also i haven't been exercising i normally try to walk about half an hour a day but the weather's been kinda colder and kinda drearier so you know i'm not as motivated when the weather's kinda blah so it's a combination of both not getting my exercise and not getting eight hours sleep mhm uh as i said before um tired <laughter> i'm i it's a combination of the weather you know and here in los angeles right now we're have been having very grey days i live very close to the ocean so the sun doesn't come out that much so i'm not getting my serotonin <laughter> i need that i um i'm not getting my eight hours of sleep because you know whatever and i think my thyroid is acting up too so that's kind of creating you know i have some vitamin deficiencies and you know once the sun comes out i'm kinda more energetic it just gives you that more energy so no mm mm no i am i'm happy most of the time i'm a pretty happy person and i like to be around other people i mean of course i like my private time but i do like being around people quite a bit so hmm <laughter> can't think of anything right now i mean i usually enjoy everything i do there's nothing that stands out more than anything else so no i never regret anything uh huh what advice would i have given well i guess yeah i could probably change things around i think it everybody could um i probably would've had a different college major um you know seems like <laughter> uh what else um i probably wouldn't have dated certain men <laughter>um wasted time with certain people um i don't know those are the things that come to mind maybe started saving money earlier you know those types of things but mm outgoing lots of fun to be with um uh just a good friend to have people like having me for a friend i'm loyal trusting and uh i listen i'm a good listener i'm very patient <laughter> as well so mhm well <laughter> number one would be to lose weight but i think that's a worldwide problem i mean there's a lot of food around and temptations and um especially here in america a lot of us are couch potatoes we sit in front of our computers we you know it's just easy to relax <rel> it's so easy to relax you know it's hard to get up and move around you have to talk yourself into it so that's the weight you know has gives you more energy too if you lose weight so that's a big thing as well but that's probably the thing just the weight thing yeah mhm i think you might've asked me that question before <laughter> but uh if you want i'll repeat it so um i'm very uh like i said i'm very loyal uh when i tell people i'm gonna do something i do it very reliable uh i i'm warm i'm very friendly i'm um great listener and i you know i've heard so many people tell me they just like being with me so like i said i'm very i'm pretty upbeat you know i'm don't <d> i don't let things get me down too much so hmm that's a hard question <laughter> the can't think i mean i'm can't think of to answer that one <laughter> so <laughter> for fun well i love movies i could see every movie that they make um i love going out with my friends shopping swapmeets um my gosh and traveling is great road trips um that's kind of you know part of it yeah that i mentioned so traveling getting to see different places the history aspect of it um the foods enjoying foods in diffferent countries uh the architecture it's just kinda neat to get away and see a completely different place mhm okay well <laughter> i've um been to a lot of places in europe i love paris uh it's such a walking city you can whoever designed that city i'll tell ya i mean it's you can get from one point to another the subways are great um each area has its own distinctive kind of there's the latin quarter where the students are there's another area where let's say the fashion designers are um kinda like our rodeo drive here in beverly hills there's an area that is more african <af> african and they have swapmeets on the weekends that are wonderful for international and then like i said once you get out of paris there's just so much history you can go see versailles then there's other palaces you can go to the south of france you know it's but that's probably my favorite country i've been to italy as well so uh yeah well after college people usually i mean people that go to college or either before or after college that's a great time to go to europe because you're young and you're not tied down you don't have a family and um you kinda have a more adventuresome spirit  you got more energy so carrying you know backpack or suitcases is not <laughter> not a big deal um so yeah that's mhm yeah <laughter> mhm thank you goodbye,1

390,<sync> yes i'm doing pretty well um i have some stressful circumstances going on but um um right now i'm i'm engaged i'm from minnesota mhm uh thirty one years ago half my life um frequently i've been back there quite a bit um but over the years not not that often um well it's a a whole different experience you know i i got back there to see my my family and and old friends and uh so it's uh l_a is is home it's nice to return here uh to be an actor uh i'm just actually getting around to it i was in another business for uh twenty five years and um now <clears throat> finally i can't put it off anymore um the economy um it's as easy to find work in uh show business it seems as it is any thing any of the other jobs i've done in the past um oh a whole variety of things um but mostly uh having to do with theater uh well to to be a successful actor you know would be nice and uh outgoing with elements of shyness um well i i i read and i cook and um um that's mm that's about it uh uh i oh i'm a big radio listener is uh to uh um talk radio uh national public radio and uh more uh and not uh crazy stuff um the sensible listening uh nice content uh interesting human interest uh mhm oh um well i'm i also i i um a comedian <cuh> comedian and so i like to listen to radio shows that have comedy mhm like uh um i'm pretty good i mean i'm not perfect but i i i i can get very upset oh probably with my wife about um my uh <clears throat> methods of of job hunting and like that it's um it's difficult um she uh um we're we're very different and uh have very different m_o's and uh so uh uh for me to uh um do things my way is is not always easy oh um well just the other night i i was uh performing in a nightclub and had an opportunity to uh introduce myself to a a very famous person and i um i didn't do it um uh i'm not sure i'm i guess uh i didn't know if it would be appropriate to approach him hm i can't think of uh i can't think of one um um well <clears throat> i've been married for it'll be twenty four years in uh july which is a couple of months and um uh my wife and i have not been sleeping in the same bed for about three years and um but we have a uh a very high achieving daughter who's going to graduate from high school uh this this spring and um she's just a uh gotten accepted at a college that she wants to go to with a very nice uh scholarship mhm um yeah well uh <laughter> my daughter's been very low maintainance for me um perhaps more so for my wife but she's always been uh an excellent uh uh child um mm <clears throat> well we're more similar i think than different uh i'm well i'm much more uh aware of what's happening in the world and and much more informed than my parents were um but uh as in terms of child rearing i think um i don't know we're all we've all been kind of hands off and um uh my wife has been more hands on um uh well the financial responsibility it um wanting to uh make sure that your child has everything that her peers have and uh not wanting her to uh um not have the same as her friends and she has uh very wealthy friends so that's um uh i am not a uh a gifted money maker and so uh it's a it's a a struggle but uh we we we keep on keep up um oh a couple of different um one preacher um uh whose church i attended for about twenty years until he died um um was very influential and also another spiritual guru uh um that uh sort of put me on a path to breaking patterns of behavior that uh were kind of dictated by my upbringing oh just um well instead of working for somebody else being able to um start a business and and be in business for yourself and and to uh um you know not be dependent on uh um just one source of income oh meeting one particular woman um when i first got out here um she left me uh less than healthy um physically and uh yeah um well i i self medicate to go to sleep which i probably don't have to do but i um uh about half the nights i i wake up um much earlier than i would like to oh usually um just mostly to have to go to the bathroom um um well i i i cope pretty well i i guess i'm just not quite as functional as i'd like to be um there are a couple of nights a week when i work until <sniff> two o clock from in the morning and don't get to bed until three and and then i um normally if i i i need seven hours if i only get five or six then i'm you know sluggish and um very anxious well um i have big um uh i have bills to pay and um not a lot of income coming in yeah it's um 'cause i don't like to fall behind and um i feel like i'm worried about losing ground and um the stakes are are high and uh so uh it's an uncomfortable position no um i am a classic um depressive uh and um yeah i guess i have i i guess i have i see <s> i do see a therapist and uh um though <clears throat> mm the mm therapist i'm seeing now is not trying to um prescribe drugs or medications um and uh previous ones have uh probably um six years ago um well my wife kind of pushed me into it um she thought um it was uh a way of i think getting help finding work and um it's not as uh it's just uh good <g> uh uh enjoyed uh having someone to talk to um not really yeah oh um just uh kind of not wanting to uh face the day just kind of wanting to um just uh kind of a weariness with the struggle uh and um just uh i displeasure with my life yes they're what i don't understand that word oh um well i um it's something i look forward to because um i i feel like i'm talking to someone who um understands me mm um i i can't i i don't know um um well each little um acting gig that i get makes me happy but uh you know just mildly happy and they usually turn out to be disappointing experiences and so um uh i never over excited <ex> excited um with happiness uh mm um well um yesterday i i made a a dessert uh to celebrate my daughter's uh scholarship and uh it was delicious and and we really enjoyed that mm um hm no um except meeting that one woman uh uh i don't know probably try a little harder you know <fidgeting with mic> uh i had started this business um um around that time and um it was it was um just it was difficult but uh we were successful at it and um uh i guess i could've gotten it rolling even more um so that it wouldn't be so um dead today oh um getting out of town um going going away when uh when uh which is rarely possible but uh yeah um well my daughter's a great source of pride and um um the fact that i've been pretty successful in uh my endeavors um and now i'm just uh going for the the big the big apple and uh uh and i hope to be successful there

392,<sync> yes i'm doing well uh california i like the weather i like the people i don't like the traffic uh that's primarily it sociology yep uh it's a topic that just really interested me the most out of all the other subjects no to be a writer um i like being able to write what i want to write uh right now i write things that i'm not really that interested in like uh articles about uh teenager culture stuff like that um i think they have it pretty easy they don't know how easy they have it <laughter> uh no not really mm depends on the situation or who i'm around when i first meet people i can be shy uh but if it's someone i've known for a while i can be outgoing um i'll lay down or try some sort like deep breathing or uh just maybe do something that's kinda fun and mind numbing like watch t_v i'm pretty good i don't really let anger show that much um i'm not like a i don't have a fiery temper or anything like that i'm pretty rational um i actually can't remember when the last time i argued with someone was 'cause it's been so long um i guess i feel guilty about the fact that i don't talk to my grandparents as much as i should um i'm close with my grandparents but not really anyone else in my family uh 'cause they basically sort of raised me uh and uh my parents weren't really in the picture that much um <sigh> i can't really think of one right now uh i guess uh when my sister died it was really traumatizing mhm yeah yes um i guess the hardest decision i've ever had to make is deciding whether or not to divorce my husband uh because we weren't getting along and there was no reason to stay married but i still felt like i should stick it out i mean it was hard at the time uh but i made the right decision i think uh my grandmother was a positive influence from a young age um she's just a very strong powerful uh sort of staunch character and that rubbed off on me uh not really super easy um i sort of i mean it's my probably my fault i go to bed too late just sort of foggy and distracted i have trouble concentrating you mean like my body uh normal fine no complaints no it's been the same as ever no no uh last night i was just hanging out with my friends and was just having like a really good time sharing stories and laughing and stuff uh probably funny and uh easy to get along with but also caring uh i spend my ideal weekend not really doing much like maybe just sitting around and reading or going to the movies watching t_v uh no i don't think there's not i don't <do> i don't think uh i think regretting <r> regretting things is a waste of time um don't  try to don't go out of your way to try and impress people if they like you then they like you um sometimes sometimes i can be kinda lazy uh i'd like to have more of a um like sort of  uh better work ethic i guess uh just sort of putting off stuff um until you know right when it's due or after it's due things like that um  procrastinating uh <sigh> sometimes for the things that i write uh people will write negative things about me like in the comment section on a website and that'll make me feel bad <laughter> i'm uh articulate and funny and a good friend um i guess i'm most proud of the fact that uh i am satisfied with myself and my friends and my status in the world i'm proud of the fact that i feel comfortable with it um just hanging out with my friends uh sort of people watching watching a movie that's good um listening to music mhm bye,0

402,<sync> yes okay atlanta georgia um in two thousand and six never uh i don't like it there <laughter> oh it's completely boring and there's very little to do l_a is preferable i think to most places uh because uh i was engaged to my fiancee and we lived in florida i moved there to be with him and um he loves the water but i love the mountains and i missed hiking and uh i didn't love florida and he wasn't tied to it so we decided we wanted to go somewhere we could both be happy and also have um more opportunities in business and all of the great things that it has to offer very <laughter> very easy there's not much i don't like about l_a i love l_a um i think it feels magical uh so many creative different people of all ages um shapes sizes colors races um the mountains the water uh the city all the things that there are to do all the people there are to meet i just i love everything about l_a no uh i'd rather not talk about it um i didn't go to college i'm still figuring that out um i don't know it may may have something to do with animals i have a dog that i really love and i never had a dog um as an adult i had cats and uh um i think i'm a late bloomer so i'm working on that whole conversation i don't i really don't want a job i want a purposeful way to create wealth not just something to make money in the long run it depends on the situation but in general i consider myself more shy although most people would consider me to be outgoing mm put on classical music <laughter> music classical music if i'm especially <ex> especially stressed and um play with my dog go for a walk i think i'm really good at controlling my temper for the most part um before i came here <laughter> um it was just about um financial stress uh um there's probably a lot of examples i think i'd rather move to another question yeah i'd rather not talk about that either <laughter> i'd rather not talk about that not very easy at all um a lot better recently but um i have a history of chronic insomnia and some health problems so it's challenging um not to feel rested most of the time in the past week i've been feeling a lot better um yes i um the weather has changed spring has sprung it's a little warmer i was having um more trouble with my depression in the winter and um having trouble with tolerating cold and so i wasn't doing  a lot of the things that i normally do and i also was sick with the flu um and in the past week i decided um that i was feeling better enough that i needed to kind of get out of my rut and start um getting more focused around things things that i need to do during the day and walking my dog  every day and um not isolating so much and seeing some of my friends more so i was seeing i've been feeling a lot better like i've been making progress and um that uh in the past week things have taken a more positive turn no yes uh it's been quite some time officially it's probably been i don't know exactly but let's see maybe more than fifteen years ago um i was feeling suicidal no um because i found a better alternative um i have been in therapy off and on since i was eighteen and i've tried a variety of um methods and then uh i started working with a neurolinguistic programmer and um that was really the first person that um helped me uh make permanent changes and i was able to get off my anti depressants as well and even though i've struggled with some bouts of depression it's never been anything extremely severe and um it was one of the best things that ever happened well um i was physically ill with uh chronic fatigue syndrome and i had a client that referred me to this person um because he had cured her of that disease and um that was um he treats multiple issues and so everything is interrelated so um once i had my first conversation with him i knew it was the right step for me i was so happy um i felt like i some um i felt that i found the answer that i'd been looking for that  i hadn't given up hope and uh that um <laughter> i was on cloud nine that i i had been suffering for a a while <wh> a long time and i felt that i finally found the answer to the solution that i was looking for i was like it was the best thing i ever did in my life it was the best decision i ever made i felt extremely hopefuly for the first time in a long time <laughter> um i went to um i went to a music store because uh i had been thinking about um taking up an instrument i used to play the violin as a child and uh i've been wanting to do something that would give me more access to my creative side because i felt it's been extremely repressed and um and so i went to the music store to try out um to see what it would feel like to um to handle an the instrument again nan and see if i thought that that was something i wanted to pursue it was awesome <laughter> mm yeah i'd rather not talk about that <laughter> um well <laughter> there's probably a lot but um i'm always working on being more optimistic um it's been challenging it takes time but um yeah i wish i could hear my own internal voice better <laughter> yeah i have regrets sure yeah um value myself more so that i would make better relationship decisions uh my fiancee is the most positive person in my life my ultimate supporter uh he's i think very unique not uh not at all selfish and uh probably a little too giving for his own good but um always has my best interests at heart has the highest morals of anyone i know would give somebody the shirt off of his back um is a genius in so many ways and uh um i'm pretty lucky i think that i'm not a quitter that despite some very stressful circumstances over long periods of time i haven't given up on taking risks and um,1
412,<sync> yes okay originally from texas oh few weeks ago uh well i've been living in um palm springs actually so uh l_a there's a lot more to do and uh weather's a lot better uh for work yes uh the weather the beach a lot of activities things to do mm traffic and the uh rental is higher <high> a lot higher here uh at at first it was a little difficult but then i adapted uh just in the united states uh new experiences uh learn a lot of things uh yeah one time i went uh yosemite and up through san francisco uh i really enjoy the beautiful scenery uh probably when i uh last year i i uh met a girlfriend up in uh san francisco and drove down highway one and uh saw a lot of uh sights hearst castle things like that uh computer science uh well i went to school back in the eighties and uh computers were uh kind of a new new up and coming thing so decided to to do that little bit not too much uh probably um i think to have like a little uh little magazine uh well i've started already started it it's like a small uh local magazine that has uh coupons and uh going to expand it to different uh parts of california probably shy um mm well let's see not uh i guess not as outgoing as many of my friends um actually i uh go dancing i like dancing it's relaxing to me uh uh uh i do latin dancing so i do it several times a week so last weekend i went very good um i i think i argued with someone a couple of weeks back it was about a religion religious issue um felt okay mm um see can't think of one right now <laughter> let's see maybe uh when i was doing one of my real estate sales um i was um sometimes the clients are pretty uh pretty difficult and i think i should've been like a little more uh assertive with them mm probably uh moving to california well i was uh leaving my friends and family in texas and um just pretty much starting a new life out in california out here uh well it was it was pretty difficult but you know i got adjusted well um i have only an aunt and a few cousins left so uh it's it's not too much a relationship i have a a a great a uh an aunt that's the sister of my mom and uh you know i send her texts periodically but uh most of the time i really don't have  much uh contact with family um probably parents both of them were very supportive mm probably when the parents were sick and passed away no uh well i both parents were um uh got sick and uh got dementia and uh it's you know one parent didn't remember who i was so it was uh that part was pretty difficult well they they passed away so it's just uh it's been about ten years so it's uh just um it's just memories now mm not too easy uh it's just tossing and turning i think all night and uh probably thinking thinking too much about things uh probably like the future things like the economy and uh my work things like that uh tired tired <laughter> mm just uh not as positive no no mm probably uh few weeks ago i received a pretty good uh real estate commission so i was happy about that uh when i'm in l_a um going to some of the meet up groups or some some of the uh i like going to whole foods and and trying some new uh places to go salsa dancing no mm probably to be more uh outgoing mm probably be more successful in uh business and be a little more uh uh outgoing mm probably my boss uh he's pretty uh condescending and um really likes to belittle people and uh <laughter> put him uh put himself as the king so he he has says a lot of comments to make himself build himself up and uh belittle whoever whoever else is in the room uh it's well usually when you go in uh he likes to brag on how much money he's made in the business and uh then say things like uh see see how much better i am than you are uh you've look how much money i've made this year and and you're the worst piece of shit agent there is things like that mhm um probably uh i have integrity and a good heart hardworking honest um probably i just went i guess uh some of the times i've gone dancing uh i went to a casino uh in a little town called temecula i met a lot of new friends and uh it uh dancing and meeting friends new friends um probably it was about it uh education i guess my education and uh able to uh move move out here where i wanted to go thank you bye,1
413,<sync> yes i'm doing okay i'm from greenwich connecticut yes um i moved here in two thousand eight so about five years ago um i try to go back at least once a year sometimes i go more sometimes less um overall i think i like where i'm from better than l_a in general um i think that other than it being somewhere i'm familiar with the type of people that are there are just more my type and what i'm used to and it's less superficial <tisk> um i moved out here for college after i graduated high school and my mom and sister live in california um initially it was easy because i felt like it was a new experience so you kind of adapt and just are experiencing everything at once but then after the first few years when it really sets in how different it is and what life is out here it became more difficult than originally uh fine arts and photography um i was interested in photography since high school um i did a lot of programs and got awards and things like that and publishments so i decided to pursue art um yes i have a fine arts degree that i got last year and scrubbed_entry yeah i really enjoy working or interning in forensics um i like that better than initially what i wanted to do was freelance photography i feel like it's a more secure job and it's very interesting um that's a interesting question i guess just my childhood in general growing up um well my family's very close um my extended family as well and they all live <li> most of them live within the area or in the east coast in general so we would always do large family uh parties and things for holidays and religious purposes and things like that yeah it is really fun and we try and all get together as much as possible which is more difficult now since everyone is spread out amongst different states and countries um i consider myself more shy um i watch reality television i think it's kind of funny and lighthearted um i watch like bravo t_v like the real housewives shows and just like funny things that you don't really need to pay attention to um i'm good i guess i don't really have like a temper if i'm having if i'm more stressed out it it definitely shows in in my attitude it but i don't really have like anger um well me and my boyfriend like bicker all the time <laughter> just like about like insignificant things but other than that um i had an argument with my dad a few days ago um there's been like some tension going on since i went and visited over the holidays this past winter things about his girlfriend and he thinks that i should be the one to make some kind of effort to have a relationship with her although he doesn't for whatever reason think that it should go both ways so for like the thirtieth time he we were on the phone and he was <sigh> telling me how i need to call her and speak to her and i told him that i was going to do it over this past weekend 'cause of the jewish holidays and he kind of was just like very mature and telling me oh forget it she doesn't want to hear from you now and kind of just like i could care less because i i don't care about having a relationship with her so if she doesn't wanna hear from me you know it's easier for me um i mean every time <t> i mean it's been the same recurring argument a lot and i wish that i could sometimes i do but i wish that the times that it turns into an explosive fight that i could just bite my tongue but the thing is is that he says certain things that are untrue or things he knows that like will tick me off that are really nasty and that he shouldn't be saying to me so he so i kind of just like lose it and i can't really mm like not say anything um well i guess the hardest decision i made which i it didn't i only realized that it's the hardest decision like looking back is once you decide where to after you graduate high school where to go to college because for me i basically changed my entire life and moved away and did all that on my own so it didn't seem like that hard of a decision at the time it felt like just like a progression of the next step but looking back now that's probably one of the hardest decisions i made um well i wish i could erase the event or seeing my grandmother's funeral which obviously it wouldn't change anything but it wasn't seeing her there was not something i'd wanna like have in my memory um she was she was a very positive influence and always was not judgmental um and now i mean my parents are great role models just in general i mean they're very successful people so whether or not we have like disagreements or that we're separate people they kind of are good role models in terms of what you wanna have when you are older um usually it's easy the problem is staying alseep no matter how late i go to bed whether it's ten p_m or four a_m i will be up like clockwork by seven thirty or eight o'clock in the morning the latest every single day and i can't seem to figure out why i cannot stay asleep longer no i just in the morning i guess i'm a lighter sleeper but i just wake up like i just cannot stay asleep anymore which never used to be a problem this consistent but now it's i cannot remember the last time i slept past eight thirty in the morning <tisk> i mean it just makes if i have to do stuff during the day it makes it a lot more tiring but it doesn't really i'm so used to it now it doesn't really change my mood it's just part of everyday um i don't know i kind of just feel very mm like so so just no extreme highs no extreme lows it's kind of one note land i mean nothing like lately um like recently it's just i would say over a period of years i've kind of progressively become more seclusive and just reserved and not very outgoing no no i have been diagnosed with anxiety um i had some breathing problems for a day or two and i had to go to the hospital um 'cause i thought it was more serious 'cause i couldn't breathe but they said that it was a physical manifestation of my anxiety i think in the right setting and with the person who's doing it if they're open minded and the therapist is helpful and good at what they're doing then yeah no i haven't been to therapy since i was a kid um i went because my parents thought it would be a good idea to like deal with whatever issues they were having with me but it was never i mean we just sat around and talked about my day it wasn't i didn't feel like i needed therapy at the time so i didn't really get much out of it <sigh> well i was happy when i was back home at my boyfriend's house with his family over the new year's holiday when i'm there i can always just we save up our money so it's a complete vacation i don't have to worry about paying bills i don't have to worry about what i have to do tomorrow who i have to deal with i just every morning we wake up we hang out just enjoy the day in general um i regret the college i chose to go to i didn't being from the east coast the whole collegiate system is set up a lot differently and the universities out there are not the same as the tight knit california school system out here so when i was researching colleges i kind of thought that santa monica college was just a general college just like boston college back home or you know any other school with the name college at the end of it i didn't realize until you know the end of my first year even that it was more like a transfer school like you you can't i didn't even realize you couldn't get a bachelor's degree from there when i went so it kind of create created more problems for me <sigh> well considering i'm twenty two <sigh> i'd probably say ten years ago i would give myself the advice to probably stay closer to home and to have really pursued other options rather than just be completely invested in moving to california um my best friend would describe me as a great charismatic funny outgoing socially enjoyable person which is different than how people who aren't my good friends would describe me which i mean i don't i mean it is what it is i am very outgoing and and have a great time when i'm with my friends in my element but around strangers and in like uncomfortable groups and things i just i am very shy and don't really speak much um recently my friend was visiting and we went to a clippers basketball game a few weeks ago and i really enjoyed that yeah um i'm very caring i i'm a very good judge of character which i mean i guess i mean i consider it to be a quality <qu> quality for myself um i'm very affectionate <aff> i mean i'm not very affectionate i'm more i mean i guess i guess so thanks,1
414,<sync> yeah i'm okay burbank california yeah the weather of course i think everyone likes the weather um it's not too city like chicago or new york it's um it's big enough we have beaches we're not land locked woo sometimes the smog the traffic the fact that i've just been here like my entire life almost not enough as i'd like to i go to school in chicago and i've been to new york a couple times san francisco and i took a road trip across the country that was cool i saw a couple states seeing new places um going to landmarks that i've only read about or seen pictures of um i traveled from los angeles to chicago taking route sixty six and the best part was seeing the grand canyon for the first time it was the coolest thing i've ever seen probably <laughter> happy and then just happy it was it was beautiful it was nice i haven't felt like that in a long time i was studying film it's just something i've always loved for as long as i can remember and when it came time to start applying to schools i wasn't sure what i wanted to do and um i applied to northwestern as a film student and it just ended up being the right decision ooh <laughter> um i love making movies but part of me really loves making people laugh and being in front of the camera so uh comedian a comedic <comie> <laughter> comedic actor would be totally great but that's hard <laughter> i am super outgoing and i love talking to people a lot i like i like being the center of attention usually <laughter> i um i like to watch mindless television like um toddlers in tiaras and um duck dynasty just t_v programs where i really don't have to pay attention at all i'm okay at it i get really emotional really fast but i am usually able to to keep my anger down and not like lash out at others and stuff for the most part sometimes i get into like arguments and fights with my friends and people who are important to me really easily and i hate apologizing to people so the fights could last pretty long um my best friend <laughter> ryan i think and it was about our relationship and just how we kind of messed it up and crossed some lines and uh where how were gonna go back to the way it was before really hard it's um he's my best friend and i miss him but we messed up and it's just it's not the same it's like not the same friendship <laughter> me too <laughter> <laughter> too many um i guess scrubbed_entry when i had a boyfriend and he has a girlfriend which was not okay i wish i would've just realized that this was bad and just would've stopped there and not have let it continue for weeks which led to my break up and then our friendship being really messed up i guess not spend as much time with him as i did be more assertive um i guess it was in november i was very depressed and suicidal so i told my friend what i was feeling and that she needed to take me to the e_r and from the e_r i had the choice to i don't know i guess go home or get sent to a mental hospital and even though i felt like i didn't have a choice i knew it was my choice and i decided to go to the mental hospital which was like the worst experience of my life ever um <exhale> it was awful it was in chicago and um it was scary i mean i didn't know anyone and they just like take all your stuff and they put you in some scrubs and they just start giving you medication and you're basically left to your own devices there were only like three group therapy sessions a day and everyone there was mostly men and um they were all really old and it was scary i didn't know anyone everyone most of the people there weren't depressed they were violent <laughter> so that was pretty scary and i just um it was really hard for me <laughter> i had been so depressed for like a month i stopped going to my classes and work and i told my teachers lies about being sick and i just kept calling in sick to work i dropped a class and i was failing my classes and not turning in any work and i wasn't talking to any of my friends and i was drinking a lot and passing out and vomiting everywhere and i was just in a really bad place and when i finally was gonna kill myself i realized i needed help it was um i had severe depression when i was a younger teenager and i tried to kill myself then and i um got put in therapy for quite some time so i figured i don't want to go down that bad path again i just wanna get better so i had to do it i had to get help i do i go once a week i feel like if you have the right therapist it's really useful i had one therapist that i really liked and i thought we could've gone really far but sadly she's back in chicago and i'm in los angeles so i have to i have to make do with this new therapist and she's okay she's not we're not that great together but she's who i had right now it's better than nothing <laughter> not that easy at all um ever since <yawn> i got out of the hospital and start and i began medication for my depression i um just haven't been able to sleep well falling asleep is hard staying <laughter> asleep is hard have really crazy vivid dreams that wake me up and are disturbing um i guess just sometimes they reflect things that i'm worried about or happening in my life but they're just they're scary and they seem so real that sometimes i wake up and i have to ask my mom like did we go here did we do this did this really happen and it's usually no you dreamed that sometimes i've gotten so scared i like talk in my sleep and wake myself up probably <laughter> like two nights ago that is a hard question i think in november <yawn> after i got out of the hospital i finally had one good day and my friend took me into downtown chicago and we went to the sears tower and got to look over those like big windows that you walk out on and see the city and that was really cool <laughter> um probably super outgoing likes to be the center of attention funny and a little bit crazy i try not to regret things in my life oh um i would say that living is worth it and just don't be afraid to ask for help when you need it don't wait until it gets really bad um i guess my ideal weekend would be <laughter> sleeping in and then catching a movie with my friends maybe going home with them and bake some cookies <laughter> eat all the cookies watch some t_v have a sleep over and then like make pancakes in the morning and watch more movies we watch a lot of movies i would like to do that <laughter> in my free time go for a walk i don't know go to the beach <laughter> um that is a hard question i mean i think i've done a lot of great things in my life and um i have achieved a lot but i think one of the proudest things proudest moments in my life is something really small and insignificant i was doing this exercise boot camp and the last person to like cross the finish line had to do like thirty push ups and it was some guy i didn't really know him at all and the trainer said does anyone wanna help him if someone helps him you have to do half each and no one wanted to help him and i just decided to start doing push ups with him and i just it wasn't 'cause i wanted to get credit or because i thought it would make me look good i just did it and no one really knows about that but it just i feel really good about that it was nice it meet you <laughter> bye,1
418,<sync> yes i'm okay i was born in mississippi um when i was two and a half years old but actually it wasn't l_a it was santa monica yes never i was only two and a half years old i don't remember anything oh i like the beach i love all the restaurants um um the music scene just the general excitement oh and the parks and all that yeah um the traffic the um the maintenance on the streets all the pot holes um um the pollution well i studied a number of things at school um i studied um um at one point i was i i had majored in public relations journalism specialization in journalism and i also studied um i was a pre law major and so i studied the law and then i also studied um um human um human services courses mhm um mainly because i'm a people person and i enjoy helping people wow my dream job hm mm my dream job hm i don't really have one right now no i don't and i can't even see your shoes um um listen to music watch horror movies i love <luh> i love horror flicks um and i have a fish tank too so i like to watch my fish also like to play tennis when i can i haven't been able to play lately though because of physical problems um mm it's just that um i had injured uh my my my ankle because i have anemia <aneenia> and um and i got dizzy one night and i fell on my ankle and on my leg and so i'm just waiting for that to really heal but i'm planning to get back um into tennis it's one of the things i enjoy doing it really relaxes me i really don't have a temper over the years i've learned how to do how to control that probably would've been yesterday but there was no argument and what was it about nothing that i can recall <laughter> something i feel guilty about hm there's nothing right now that i feel guilty about mm oh a situation that i wish i had handled differently i really can't think of one right now the hardest decision oh um the absolute hardest decision that i ever had to make um was when my uh i had twins twin twin twin boys they're grown now i had twins twin teen teenagers and um i had lost my job and we were living in a motel and the rent for the motel was outrageous i couldn't no longer continue to pay the um pay the type the type of money that they wanted so i had to briefly um um put my son under the in in foster care for for for a minute that was the hardest decision that i had to make scrubbed_entry um a schizophrenic and he had had um he was born with auditory processing deficit which he overcame through training with a speech therapist and and school officials and he also this is he also lost his hearing when he was four years old um but and then when he turned fourteen the schizophrenia came up um so right now he he's in a supportive living environment he's twenty seven years old um but he he he's come to terms with his mental illness and he accepts it now i had problems in the past 'cause he didn't wanna take the medication you'd give him the medication and he'd hide it stick it in his pocket or whatever so but he's come to terms with that and we've all have come to terms with that and he's doing he's doing pretty good scrubbed_entry um that son he's twenty <twen> he's twenty seven as i said 'cause he's a twin um um was living in texas with his wife and um he got a promotion to um scrubbed_entry now he's in california too both are in california okay so um i feel very good about that yeah uh hm well of grown children yes <laughter> of grown children yes no no no no no no no no i take that back not it's not hard to be a parent of grown of my grown children okay when they were younger there were difficult times okay difficult periods and um just it was a lot of good times too but yeah it was there were some difficult times mm well the mm the difficult times i really pretty much already alluded to and that was when um one of my twins got the diagnosis of schizophrenic and um and um they were in temporarily and in in well one was in foster care and one was actually um in a institution 'cause of the um the um schizophrenia um so think i lost track of the question <laughter> the hardest thing about being a parent at this point at this <the> at this point in my life there is is nothing hard about it um the best thing about being a parent i don't know i guess it's just to see <cough> something that you created um develop into a you know pretty decent human being you know a decent person that's the best thing oh a lot of ways um well actually i didn't have two parents i had a mother and the father was never in my father was never in the home and he lived in another state so i had no contact with him um but the thing that i do differently than what my mother did um she was a strong disciplinarian um both verbally and physically um and she at she had this tendency which she outgrew she had this tendency to be very critical okay critical and um um opinionated <laughter> and very religious um and sort of sort of looked at people who were not and that was me um as if they were living life wrong because they were not going to church or reading the bible and that kind of thing what was the other part of the question i i i don't get a good night's sleep or i don't sleep at all unless i take medication and that's that that's all there is to it if i don't take medication i don't sleep i'll be up all night i'll i will be up for days if i don't take medication man irritable um and tired <laughter> well well lately you know just a little anxious really um you know um i just recently um made a move to a new apartment it's a lot of expenses and new expenses and things like that you know and new furniture and new this and that that you have to get which um i've i managed to do all of that but um the whole thing was kind of stressful yes mhm no not p_t_s_d yes um that was back in i think two thousand and four um because um my life had gotten so stressful to the point where it was either i had to do something or or end something to tell you the truth yeah um yes mhm yeah i think it's useful um you know as a good sounding board you know someone to throw you know your concerns out and you know discuss things that may be bothering you or good things too yeah i think therapy with medication um since i've been going to therapy um the changes a lot of changes um i've been more focused more hopeful um hm it it's just been a good experience for me which is why i continue to go really happy well i can feel really happy um by some occurrence i can't think of anything right now just like that and then i go back to how i was feeling so i can't really pinpoint anything really i mean eh eh i mean if something comes to me unexpectedly or if things go right for a change and continue to go right as opposed to things going wrong all the time that that makes me happy when things go right how about that hm mm something i did recently that i really something i did recently that i really enjoyed mean really really enjoyed recently hm i can't think of anything i don't have a best friend um my best qualities are that i'm a honest person i genuinely give people the benefit of the doubt um everyone in my book is as they appear to be until they prove prove it differently um i'm very generous overly generous <laughter> um and i'm very i like to help other people i mean help you know i'm on a personal level help people you know with anything whatever their problem is it gives me pleasure to do something for somebody else that's helping them out mhm anything i regret how so there's only one thing i regret and that is that um after my twins became um became old enough to um start going to um school the elementary school level um i was taking some courses um as a pre law major and um at that time i was married to their father who who turned out not to be a good fit for me and because of the stresses involved with him you know knowing that that was gonna end and i was gonna leave him um i dropped out of college so that was my biggest regret hm stay in school no matter what stay the course no matter what that i'm a good person i'm a good human being that's all okay goodbye,1
422,<synch> hi sure alright uh originally originally i'm from uh korea mhm uh when i was a year old yes uh almost never i've i've been to korea once uh i love the weather <sigh> and being by the ocean and the culture has a lotta things to do the food there's a lot to like um the traffic um it seems like we're having a lot of uh economic difficulties and the the parking tickets are super high i sometimes i'm really annoyed by our government <laughter> by your shoes did you say by your shoes <laughter> your shoes aren't showing um i have traveled a bit i'm i'm sort of traveled i haven't traveled in a little bit in a little while oh just <sigh> it um it helps you keep things in perspective about our life here um it's exciting and it makes me feel like um i'm actually <act> i'm really living 'cause sometimes we're stuck in this bubble here in l_a and seeing other places you realize that you know life is about a lotta different things that you don't think about every day well um one of my trips i went uh i went to singapore and then to thailand and it was when i was with my ex-boyfriend and we went to um he had <ha> he was uh uh a sales engineer or systems engineer but he he did well that year and so this was kind of like a a company thing so we went to singapore for a few days and that was really interesting um you know of course eh it's a lot different over there um not just like going to canada or something but they had a big reception the evening we got there and they had like a play put on by the principals of the company which was real fun and um after singapore uh we did some tours in singapore it was really it was a interesting experience it's really clean there and it's really there's not a lotta crime but the government is very it it's a little bit imposing but it was very interesting then we went to thailand and that was almost <almo> it was really completely different 'cause it's like jungle we went to um phuket it's a little island and it was just it was very primitive compared to singapore just in a lotta different ways but it was very interesting and it was nice and everything was really cheap had a massage on the beach for eight dollars <laughter> it was interesting yeah yeah it was an hour for eight dollars <laughter> mm well i'm in school right now and um i didn't i didn't finish school when i was younger because i had um i had health problems so um here i am i'm i'm just doing my general ed right now i'm going to s_m_c yeah i'm happy ooh <sigh> well my dream job would be <sigh> to be a veterinarian but uh it's probably not very realistic for me at this stage in life and you know also because of monetarily it costs a lot but that would be my dream job working with animals and and in in a veterinary capacity yeah i think i'm right on the cusp um it depends on the environment and the people i'm with and how comfortable i am but um i'm really outgoing when i feel comfortable with people and i'll be really reserved <laughter> if i'm not yeah <laughter> <laughter> uh <sigh> well i mean aside from sleeping um i like like relaxing things uh like going for a bike ride on the strand or um if i'm at home uh just like reading or a lotta times i can just lay there and my mind might be doing things but i'm kinda relaxing ah really good i don't have i would say there's certain things that um they can really like make me like when i see injustices or things like that then i mean i can really feel it but i never just like fly off the handle or throw things or uh even you know yell <laughter> <sigh> argued um <sigh> i can't really say i have arguments i mean just like a disagreement or an actual argument like if we just well uh i would say last summer when um i think it was after a baseball game there was a group of us and we went uh to we went to have shabu shabu after the game and i don't know i think scrubbed_entry and i don't know it's it's it's kind of a tenuous friendship like mm she's a good friend in some ways and she's mm we're we're actually kinda distant in other ways so i i don't consider her um like someone that i would confide in and you know if any deep problems but um sometimes we just have she's very touchy and she doesn't have the same sense of humor i do so i think she had said some things to me during the night which mm kinda bothered me but mm you know i just kinda that's just how she is and then i guess i said some things that she felt were eh well she gets really offended easily i think <laughter> but um after that we didn't talk for a while but then we then one day she called me up and then we were friends again but like she never she never confronted me hardest decision <sigh> uh it was leaving my ex-boyfriend uh well it wasn't <sigh> it was a long time coming i mean i was thinking about it for like five years um you know he wasn't like beating me or anything he was a really good guy but we just had a lot of um we <w> we weren't always on the same wavelength and we did have a lot of like disagreements so i had thought about it and thought about it and we were already engaged but we had been together for a long time so i don't know uh i was always it was always on my mind like should i get married or should i not and then finally eh we were just always having um we were always what what's the word i'm looking for um we were just having these little snippy disagreements all the time and then one day we had one and i just decided that i was gonna leave and um i did it was really hard it was it was the hardest decision in my life and i can stay that definitively um and but i i think it was for the best <deep breath> <sigh> hmm um probably leaving my job for well to help my friend start a business in nevada and when i when i i really liked my job i mean it was it was pretty good um it was right over at the beach and when i told them that i was leaving then they offered me this huge raise and they offered me a a different position which was awesome and that was really stressful for me because um i'd already promised my friend <laughter> to leave i wouldn't have gotten the position you know offer if if it wasn't for her wanting me to come over there um it was really really stressful and i stressed over it for about three weeks until i actually left and um when i went over there like we had we had made agreements about how much they were gonna pay me and blah blah blah when i got there everything like she didn't remember telling me that i needed a certain amount and the other principals of the company were um you know the <th> it was a hard situation 'cause she had she had talked with me but they hadn't talked with me and they're like well that's too much and also they were a different religion and it was very strange i mean they were all one religion <laughter> i was i was surrounded by mormons and i i don't have anything against mormons but it was very different because eh eh i was kind of an outsider there and then also the weather was just it was absolutely awful there <laughter> so i would say that's one decision it it's it just a a pivotal point in my life and i think that um i really wish i i had just stayed <laughter> um well if you're gonna erase something from my memory then <laughter> um i would probably say <sigh> my memory like really if if i could erase something from my memory what would i want to erase is that what you're saying mm <sigh> can't really think of anything i mean even like that that bad decision that i made you know it it has value in it so <sigh> i can't really say that i would want something erased i mean maybe if i was like raped or something and it was really <sigh> horrifying then i would but i don't <sigh> well if you're talking about sleep <s> being in a deep sleep i'm in a deep sleep a lot but i never feel rested and that's um it's a medical problem of mine well i always feel like i haven't slept for two days and um there are points in in the day i would say in some <s> during some days there are points in the day where i really feel alert and alive and and rested but they're short-lived but i sleep a lot i sleep uh pretty crappy <laughter> physically pretty crappy yeah well thanks <laughter> no <sniffle> i haven't been officially diagnosed with depression but um that's that's usually what doctors um like my sleeping problem hasn't been diagnosed i'm i'm in the process of really working to get it diagnosed but um that's the first thing that they try and figure out they they've given me like depression drugs before but they haven't helped with my sleep but i do <sigh> i do <sigh> i would say i feel down sometimes <someti> well my life is very strange right now so there are a lot of reasons to feel down um i would say that i do feel down sometimes a lotta times but it's not i would say it's reasonable considering the situations that i'm in uh they're just triggered by the fact that my health is is not great and it makes it makes life really difficult but um i wouldn't say it's triggered by anything in particular oh there i mean <sigh> you mean for a long period of time or i mean i i experience happiness like when i go out with friends or i go and you know i've find some great new dish i like i mean what type of happiness are you looking for um <sigh> well i mean right now um my friend just had surgery and so i'm staying with her this week um i'm really enjoying it i mean even though we could never live together i could never live with live with her long term and i'm sure she couldn't live with me long term but i'm having fun and um you know she just she i i installed the groupon app on her ah on her phone um yesterday 'cause she's been paying too much for laser hair removal <laughter> and so i installed it on her phone and then today she's she's looking up cupcakes so she had me pick up cupcakes on the way here to bring back to her uh as a groupon deal so i mean you know there's little fun things like that <sniffle> uh <sigh> probably um o_c_d <laughter> and um she probably thinks i'm pretty prissy compared to her um i think that she would say that i have a good heart um we're very different um and probably that i'm <sigh> i should ask her <laughter> uh i don't know we we go out so i think she'd say that i'm fun um but she has mentioned that i'm i'm a very private person and that i know i i knew before she said that why um <sigh> i have <ha> well i told you i have i have a lotta problems right now and <sigh> so i don't really tell people about them um it it's kind of a it's kind of a killjoy but also people can feel i feel that people can feel less comfortable if they perceive that you have a have difficulties and they feel kind of um it just uncomfortable like oh they maybe they should help or they feel guilty but they have good busy lives so just kinda creates a gap but i would say even before even before this difficult time in my life i've been i've been a private person i don't know why i think <thi> i think a lot eh you know i'm a deep thinker and maybe it's just you know not like i feels like i feel abnormal but um maybe i just have a lotta thoughts that don't seem doesn't seem appropriate to share with people or i'm not sure <sniffle> ten or twenty years ago <sigh> um well one thing that i regret right now is um you know i haven't really found somebody you know to spend the rest of my life with so i would tell myself to concentrate more on that 'cause once you hit forty it's really <rea> it's it's a lot harder that's it um i would say <sigh> that i've perservered i'm very proud that even though i have a lot of difficulties in my life the fact that i'm you know making this commitment to go to school and i'm doing it on my own and um you know it's it's kind of a if people if people knew all the problems that i have they'd be like well you know why are you worrying about school but um i really feel that you know i'm i'm doing this and and i'm really proud that even through everything um yeah i'm getting a's thanks mm k thanks bye,1
426,<sync. yes i'm alright south l_a um the weather the women the opportunities that's about it racism police brutality injustice that's it mm no not much of a exploring type of person um psychology mhm um it was one of the classes i excelled in the most so i decided to change it from business to psychology yeah yes no to own my own record label um it it's moderately hard but you know take it one day at a time just i guess you know stay focused a little bit of both um i tend to be shy in um situations i'm not comfortable with or i'm new to and i'm outgoing in places i'm more comfortable with yeah <laughter> um turn the lights down low and listen to soft music mhm i'm getting better over the years um i think i'm pretty decent now compared to how i used to be yes ma'am um due to the lack of i guess you could say controlling my emotions i have uh gotten incarcerated sent to prison yeah mm i'm not sure uh i don't really have a recollection of my hardest decision i've made in my life um it was probably a few days ago with the girl i was talking to and i was arguing about her lack of communication and attentiveness yeah uh frustrated because um you know uh you you put in a certain amount of effort and you expect you know the same effort by the other person when you're in a relationship and at the same time when you when you have expectations sometimes you kinda set yourself up for failure so you know i guess i'm just learning there's a lot of situations i would've handled differently um probably the most recent was uh i had gotten into a physical <phy> a physical altercation with an inmate when i was incarcerated and that made me that's what sent me to prison and and i had to do a lot more time and um if i handled it differently i probably would've never went to prison i probably would've been home a lot sooner than i originally happen yeah mm there are several events i wish i could erase from my memory um probably uh my first girlfriend um she did something really uh extreme it wasn't necessary in my eyes and it and it cost <co> it could've cost me my life i think that that that's a recurring thought that i i wish i could completely erase from my memory along with the good memories as well um a few you few fights uh i guess you could say shoot outs um getting jumped getting robbed you know those things i think those inhibit me i guess to to explore certain areas of life that i'm not comfortable with so those are the feww things that it'd be nice if i could erase it completely yeah <sigh> hurting people that didn't need to be hurt emotionally especially um a few women in my life or in my past um probably putting my mother through certain things that she didn't have to go through along with my close friends and family as well um used to be rocky growing up but as i got older and matured and the certain experiences that i've been through kind of brought me closer to my family so now it's it it's pretty decent it's it's pretty decent mm i would say my mother um yeah my mother um well she she uh she had her share of experiences negative and positive um i admire her the struggles she's been through um she she she uh experienced difficult economic hardships growing up but that didn't stop her um from raising a son at a young age finishing school getting her master's and just just overall being a a good person and she also battled mental health issues as well and um probably not the best of family that she could've been raised with so she so she's kinda of like a a inspiration to to me and other people as well so i would say my mother mm it's not easy so yeah it's not easy i couldn't tell you i i i've always had sleeping issues um i usually just take uh like over the counter sleep medication or nyquil but it makes you drowsy the next morning so it's like it's a negative effect really yeah the medication <medi> i don't know shit i don't know but i just stopped taking it 'cause i didn't like feeling drowsy not good at all um yeah i mean i recently got released from prison not too long ago uh i'm older now and a lot more responsibilities and i feel like my life is not where it's supposed to be i feel like i could've made a lot more better decisions in my life you know sometimes feeling sorry for myself and just things that i've been through and the whole nine yards so yeah it's all good yeah so true yes <sniffle> about two and a half three years ago <deep breath> <sigh> myself i um i was i was just tired of not i don't know i guess school kind of made me seek help because i started to understand myself how my brain works um you know so i decided to seek help maybe to better my life yeah you could say that yes i am yes yes i do actually i do mm better decision making um better tools to reflect on choices um how to control uh certain situations better yeah um <sniffle> well instead of just always reacting on emotion no matter what kind of emotion it is i step back and and and i assess the situation you know to see what's what's the best way to to react towards the situation and by doing that it has made me more mature emotionally more mature and just has a positive outcome <laughter> um i was lying next to a beautiful woman who who cared about me and the feeling was mutual so that was probably the most happy oh my goodness spontaneous um outgoing sometimes a little crazy um fun that's about it nothing um like i said earlier just you know hurting the the few women that were in my life my past and my friends and family that's about it oh shit uh school is really important um how i carry myself the people who i surround myself with and what i choose to do in my free time those are the few things i would tell myself good music um a good game of basketball um sex um i like going out i like going to parties um social gatherings where everyone's friendly and and there's no drama that's what i like dancing beautiful women a couple drinks that's about it um i guess not not necessarily giving up and and um just just i don't know just keep going just just not giving up really yeah mhm bye bye,1

440,<sync> yes i'm okay thank you um i was born in east los angeles and yes um the freedom to explore outdoors and with different um weather temperature <temp> you know with weather <clears throat> temperature and climates to go skiing or to the beach maybe in the same day i like that um mm i think probably the overcrowding um and the smog mm not not frequently but i have meeting other people and learning about their environment and their cultures sure um the last trip i've taken outside of here was to italy and um that was my second time being there and i enjoyed it more this time because um i knew what i wanted to see when i came back and um and i was better prepared for italians and their culture i felt i wasn't as uh you know i was just better prepared i thought for that trip um <clears throat> that would be um being in the countryside and seeing a very tiny house in the midst of acres and acres and acres of grapes was just magnificent um human development um <clears throat> i actually didn't decide at first to do that i started school with the intent of being a lactation consultant and um i went to a program in which you could get a degree as well as get your license to become a lactation consultant and through the process i learned that um i had to do a long internship without pay and at the time <t> and i miss i had a family so i had to make a different <diff> a career choice quickly and um so the college offered human development as a major and i um just went right in and used my used <u> used my units that i had already acquired towards that particular major and and i'm happy with it um currently no i stay at home i have a little one uh well he's not so little i'm preparing to go back to work um in the meantime i design jewelry well i have three children um i have a almost four year old and then i have two older children seventeen and twenty three no um that your children the the love <sigh> from them and for them is unconditional all the stages that they go through they're stages all the time for every age <laughter> and then everybody in my household is all different because they're different ages so um i think i'm probably more in tune with those different stages that's why it makes me crazy um and i think that my parents the time that my parents were parents it was just kinda like you know is she fed is she dressed she has a house i mean a roof over her head and we're doing great as parents and we love her and so it wasn't um there wasn't too much i felt that that parents thought about in terms of that in terms of parenting in that way and like today you know there's books for every age every year month you know <clears throat> and um so i think it difference differs in that way tremendously very close <clears throat> outgoing mm i don't i don't um feel uninhibited <u> uninhibited i feel a little you know confident to talk to people i probably talk more than i need to <laughter> um <clears throat> i bead i <clears throat> do i design jewelry that's what i do to relax i'm pretty good i i well i think i um try not to not to um feel or let others know what my emotions are when i'm upset um which is not good 'cause if i don't do anything with them then i know that at some point it's gonna come out and um yeah that that's uh something i have to work on like exercising or something um <clears throat> it was my husband and it was about um he asked me whether i thought about cheating ever in our marriage on him uh really tired of talking about that same topic um well it came it spawned from <f> from a client of my husband's who's a female and she shared with him that she'd been cheating on her husband for like a year because she resented him for many things and um <clears throat> and so he took that information and came home and decided to ask me if i ever thought about it and what made me think about cheating and he knows that i've been resentful of him and did that make me feel like it did that make me want to cheat or did i think about cheating <clears throat> and um <sigh> i we've had this conversation a lot of times and uh i mean not just that but i don't know just about cheating in general and um so i just said what i normally said normally say is that i haven't um cheated and that i did think about that when we were first together and uh but it was just a mere thought and um and then his response was i know that if we cheated on each other we would never tell one another and that just kinda <sigh> i guess irritated me i was really bothered by that and i just started thinking you know we're having this conversation yet again and why are we having this conversation <laughter> are you the one that's cheating and so that's how that that went into that um argument i mean it wasn't ayelling <y> yelling i mean it was part conversation and part texting um <sigh> not talking at all <laughter> um <sigh> mm pretty much any situation that involves my children and if i've yelled because i really don't like if i came to the point where i've had more of yelled it bothers me because um i was yelled at a lot and i just feel bad about that and i try really hard to not handle any kind of situation that involves my children no matter how upset i might get and result in in yelling hmm that would probably be whether to keep a pregnancy or not yeah yeah i um i was just talking about it yesterday actually and um oh i was pregnant and i had wanted i wasn't married yet and i had wanted to be married and but i just didn't think that i it was the right time for me and um i had pretty much made up my mind that i was not going to keep that pregnancy but i made the decision by myself and when my partner found uh discovered that i was pregnant he said that he very much wanted to have a child and wanted to marry me and so that decision was quite hard because i felt obligated to do so and felt super guilty to not and <drops microphone> oops and uh this is on correctly um hang on this ear piece is falling there we go that was probably the hardest decision actually you know what no i wouldn't say that's the hardest decision i ever had to make i'm sorry the hardest decision that i had to make in my life was whether or not <clears throat> um the hospital should um unplug the life or um life support machine for my father or not that was the hardest decision um because i knew that the quality of life he wanted for himself was more than that and to have been um to resort to the situation that he was in not capable of doing anything at all either speaking for himself um was beyond it who he was and i just couldn't see him like that anymore and he would be a vegetable i was told so i agreed to um resort that not hardly ever <laughter> too many things running on my mind um and pretty much um mostly on the weekends because my older kids are out and about with their friends uh even though i know that they're gonna come <co> i mean i'm constantly worried about uh how they are when they come home and so i really can't fall asleep on the weekends most of the time but um and you <y> sometimes it's just been so many days of not getting a good night's sleep i'm just exhausted <ex> exhausted i pass out but it's hard very stressed mm my son is is um has been uh in dealing with some legal issues and um currently is incarcerated and uh it's been really hard yes i've been probably very short moody irritable well i often think about a lot of things that aren't even happening <laughter> my mind just goes from one point a to point b and i don't even know how i got there um you know it's interesting uh yeah no yes about three years ago um my um o_b_g suggested i i uh see a psychiatrist yes well um i've in the process of changing therapists so it's been about because the program that i was in um lost funding and i lost my therapist or the therapist that i was working with and so it's been about two months maybe three now and um but i did notice when i was in therapy um that it was just an intricate part of my my life my week to see my therapist um it really helped me cope um <sigh> when i picked up my son <laughter> up from um when he was released from um jail um a go getter uh probably you know uh she would use the term hustler but meaning that i'll i'm not afraid to do a lot of different kinds of jobs to do what i need to do to support my family i mean you know legally of course um outgoing um maybe sometimes a little too for too outgoing for her um and compassionate sensitive loyal mm all the things that remind me of my mother <laughter> well yelling the yelling part was one um just <j> just the little things that used to drive me so crazy i see <s> can see myself doing them and it bothers me a lot regarding what mm <clears throat> um not too much really i don't know <clears throat> to go to college right after high school and not wait um and <sigh> that i didn't really need to be in a relationship to be happy or that you don't have to be in a relationship to be happy that you can certainly be successful and not in a relationship and still be happy and live life um what did i do mm i visited my son yesterday and that was really good yeah i was happy that he was safe um my children and uh my accomplishments in um school and work bye,1

cultivate a mind love someone unconditionally well i went through a lot of trauma as a child so as a parent i was very afraid for my child to go through that same trauma tried to protect him from it i think it's really hard 'cause you never really know people what they'll do outgoing because if i'm in a room with people i'm usually the first one to start talking as a matter of fact i have fish aquarium that's what keeps me calm not very good <laughter> seems like everyday i argue with somebody about something but yesterday um a lady tried to cut line in the grocery store and i politely told her i was in line and she didn't wanna move  yes it has because sometimes if people don't want to move then i feel it's my place to move them hurting people physically uh if i feel disrespected or somebody puts their hands on me i can get very ugly i don't like that about me um i was pulled over by the police and they had uh someone with my name and they were very rude to me and i really wasn't happy with the way they treated me um how to stay calm when someone has crossed over into my boundary my personal space i can't let people get too close to me if they do i i lash out i don't want anybody in my  area of protection i guess stay away from people <laughter> stay away from it's hard you can't live in this world without other people sometimes they just irritate the heck out of me being assaulted in the military is something i wish i could forget just that i felt helpless alone ashamed and angry that's about all i wanna go into eighteen yeah very young no because i was assaulted and and i have a fear of people in uniform like the policemen hurting me or um other military veterans hurting me when they explode or go off or have issues of p_t_s_d i can't remember i worked for the federal government well it just seemed like a normal progression um federal government gives you ten points preference over other people for being in the military so it seemed like a natural choice a organization that had a book of rules and they followed them the government one government to another yes well it was hard in the sense that in the military you're given um you're told to handle it handle it and in the civilian world you have to go through so many hoops and different people to talk to to get something done administration of justice no um i don't work anymore oh yeah almost two years the feeling that i was always gonna be hurt that someone was out to get me i had nightmares panic attacks anxiety attacks outburts <out> outburts of anger i was always in emotional pain and i always wanted to hit somebody yes mostly disrespect but i feel it's disrespect of people getting too close to me or i feel in fear of them for some reason i can't remember the last time i had a good night's sleep what irritable angry moody pissed off irrational tired sick of the world angry at the world wanting to be left alone sometimes i don't wanna go on yes oh yeah <laughter> oh yeah well i i could recognize a trigger now when something is gonna trigger me i can at least know and uh act  accordingly if i want to <laughter> when i saw my grandchildren when they came to visit <sniff> they're just so innocent and sweet and precious it was just a joy to have them around they make me forget about all the pain in life <sniff> <sniff> planting seeds for some vegetables making a garden <sniff> i read somewhere that it's calming and soothing to work with your hands and dirt so i decided to find out <sniff> plant something and watch it grow <sniff> sitting on the beach looking <look> facing the water thinking talking to god wishing i were somewhere else like hawaii penthouse over maui that i could trust people that i wouldn't lash out at them that i could sleep at night <sniff> crazy hot headed <sniff> emotional being in the wrong place at the wrong time don't trust anyone be careful be wary of people and what they want from you my son my

uh i'm a welder um i just i don't know something about it making and um building things and repairing things that intrigued me and uh uh i was actually pretty good at it so i stuck with it and and that's my profession <sigh> gee i really never had that i've just uh <sigh> kind of always uh hoped that i would have a job that could support myself and my family and uh i was satisfied with that well uh i just recently lost my uncle and uh he raised me since i was seven years old and uh other than my wife i don't have any more family um he passed away last uh july and uh i'm starting to get over it um i knew the day would come but he was my last living relative so i've been depressed about that and uh uh but i'm doing better it depends on the atmosphere um if i'm around people that i don't feel comfortable with i'm kinda reserved but uh if i'm comfortable and uh i feel like i fit in well i'm outgoing <laughter> <laughter> right i enjoy old movies uh old uh well it's called film noir and uh i love those old black and white movies and i get on netflix or amazon and i try to pick a movie that's uh from back then people were different than they uh i don't know it's just a different era and i enjoy it <sigh> well my wife says uh i probably not as good as i think i do but uh i've got to admit sometimes i lose my temper and it is according to her over things that i shouldn't be losing my temper about but um i'm working on it and uh i have basically had this problem ever since i was a young child oh yes <laughter> uh i've uh been in and out of trouble with the law when i was much younger i'm i'm passed that point now but uh <sigh> you know when you're young you think you know everything and uh you know you're never gonna get old and the future doesn't matter but uh it does matter because everthing that you do when you're young uh follows you for the rest of your life and i don't regret things that i've done but if i could go back i definitely would make different choices uh me and my wife we we <w> we don't argue we <sigh> disagree and it's she's very strong willed and she's a match for me <laughter> so uh we go back and forth but you know we don't get violent and we don't uh uh say meanful things or hurt each other we're just she is a determined strong willed woman and <sniff> i am who i am so we kinda go back and forth and lately i have been the one to <sigh> bow down and be the one to lower the threshold of the argument because uh in the long run it's just her and me and there's nobody else more important to me um <sigh> <tisk> when i was younger i wish that uh i didn't follow some of the people that i followed and what i mean by that is you know running in a circle with certain people and having an ego bigger than my common sense and um that's what got me into trouble <sniff> i was an only child and uh i kind of enjoyed being the center of attention and um getting the girls to laugh or having people mm think i was you know cool or whatever you wouldn't think that now i'm kinda overweight and balding but when i was in my twenties i was a a completely different person and <sniff> if i would've had some brothers and sisters i may not have thought or acted that way but i was an only child so i you know ran where people thought i was cool and that got me into trouble hardest decision i ever had to make was giving the authorization to um have my uncle pass away he was on life support and his kidneys had failed <sigh> and um doctors said there was nothing more he could do and to not have him <sigh> go through any suffering to let him slip away and as you can see i get very upset my uncle raised me like his own son and never let me down <sniff> and he's gone and for lack of a better word to push the button i never thought i would have to do that <sniff> but as i said i'm getting over it and um things are getting better slowly my wife she is uh always there for me <sniff> she will <laughter> always surprise me we she's not my wife she's my best friend <sniff> and she <laughter> knows me better than i know myself um <coughs> we enjoy uh uh doing simple things it's not that we can't do other things if we wanted to but we <sniff> mesh um <sniff> we enjoy each other's company uh we like the same things and uh we you know occasionally go out and do something together but we <clears throat> we just enjoy each other's company and she like i say knows me better than anybody and um it surprises me sometimes mhm you know <sigh> lately well i can't say lately <sniff> if i don't <coughs> excuse me if i don't do a rigorous activity or something that really uh stresses me or strains my body it it let's say for a couple of days i'm just very relaxed and you know not doing much i i just automatically get up after four and a half five hours i mean and you know my wife will say you know guy you're not getting any sleep but i mean i don't feel tired i don't feel exhausted i don't feel like i need to go back to sleep i'll stay up all day and i'm fine and most people would say that's not enough sleep but you know for me i'm it doesn't affect me <sniff> well i wish some things could be different but uh i'm not dissatisfied <sniff> um uh i'm happy with my life uh there there uh like with anybody else there's a few things that i wish were different and i think that's in anybody everybody else's uh you know life but um <sniff> i'm i'm i'm i'm i'm content yeah i feel a little less motivated <sniff> um recently well i can't say recently this was back in january um my wife and a few uh friends were noticing that i was um becoming forgetful and i i couldn't remember things i i didn't see it and um you know when they when everybody brought it to my attention then i started to but anyway i went to the doctor and um they gave me the tests and apparently i have m_c_i which is mild cognitive impairment and uh i've over the last month or so nobody has mentioned it to me i mean maybe i'm getting better but the neurologist that i saw <sss> is having me come back in a year and gonna retest me um hopefully it's not the beginning stages of alzheimer's i'm still a little young for that i'm only fifty <fif> fifty two but um i was diagnosed with uh mild cognitive impairment and uh it it could've been due also i was told by him uh because of the death of my uncle i could've been pretty depressed i was not able to retain things and so well i'm going back in a year and we'll see if uh i'm any better i'm sorry i'm not understanding you i'm sorry how <h no no i have not yes two thousand one um i was in a um uh what is the word i'm looking for <sniff> i was in a um in a state of mind of of where i was just going to get myself in trouble and and not benefit anything if i didn't seek any help um i was diagnosed with uh depression and anxiety disorder uh worrying and thinking too much about things and uh thinking the worst and uh i i take medication for that uh well <w> well you know it's not really therapy it's <clears throat> you know every uh few months you know you gotta see the doctor are you doing fine everything good and you know they just refill your prescription <laughter> it's you know it it's you know kinda like the next person next person it it's i i'm with kaiser so it's it's they'll talk to you but it they give you the impression that um you know i i okay let's move along you know they they'll <th> they'll hear your explanation but you know it it they don't have all the time for you that you may want so i i i i'm doing fine now if i really needed help i would i would do something the medication works for me <sigh> last time i felt real happy well it would depend on what the event is i'm always happy when i'm doing something with me and my wife and we're enjoying each other and i you know i'm not trying to sound like she's my whole world and i don't have anything else she is my world but um i i i enjoy being with her and we're we we do things together and <sniff> i i i'm happy all the time when when we're doing that um <sniff> when i'm outside of that circle i i i don't know if this sounds right but i'm not seeking happiness i i can only explain it as i'm content i'm not um i i'm not disappointed or i'm not uh wanting anything i'm you know whatever comes my way is fine so well um <sniff> i don't know i i couldn't give you that answer <laughter> um <sniff> well my best friend is my wife but uh <sniff> she would um describe me as uh i don't think before i speak um i um let the littlest insignificant things bother me and i get angry over but the big things it's like i let it go and she's bewildered by that <coughs> um uh <vocal fry> years and years ago um she i had a uh classic uh pontiac lemans and she had gotten into a minor fender bender and she thought it was gonna be the end of the world 'cause that was my baby and i <sigh> you know hey don't worry we'll get it fixed and she was <w> she thought <laughter> that i was gonna hang her or something you know because that was my this was you know that was my baby and uh she goes you know you you get excited over nothing but you know i something like wrecking your car that you love and you've put so many hours of work into it and money you know it gets crashed and it's like you don't care so that's the only way i can explain it well i i need to lose some weight as you can see <laughter> i'm definitely uh been on an eating binge uh and uh the neurologist said that's probably due to the event with my uncle um i'm heavy <heav> i am this is the heaviest i've ever been in my life and i'm finding it a little bit harder um i i can't say harder but i'm i'm finding the will power to say no and to stick with it and to go exercise or you know not you know  movement now going maybe for a walk you know me and my wife when we were a little bit younger we used to love going for walks <clears throat> and we lived in a scrubbed_entry uh boy you know look at that wonder what's inside there you know that that's uh we don't do that no more i guess it's we're a little bit older now and <laughter> a little bit heavier it's harder to walk with all this weight <laughter> but i i i i wish i could change that because uh i i you know it's just not healthy the size <sigh> <sigh> uh lately no i don't regret anything lately um <sniff> everything's been fine the like i say the the biggest biggest impact in my life was the event with my uncle and uh i never ever in a hundred years or ever thought that i would face that situation and <sniff> i'll never forget it but they say time heals all wounds and and it does <laughter> don't listen to other people uh again i'm not trying to bring up my uncle just because of what has happened but he used to constantly tell me to uh he would see the things that i was doing and the paths that i was going down and i constantly thought i knew better and i think a lot of youngsters think that anyway they um the young lady that i was talking to in here they think they're invincible and so did i <laughter> i figured ah i'm never gonna i'm never gonna have those problems um i wish i could've changed some things um <coughs> the history of my past follows me as it does everybody and that has limited me in in a lot of opportunities and a lot of things that i'm able to do uh i don't miss them but if i could go back uh ten or twenty years i definitely wouldn't make some of the decisions that i made my welding certificates um i'm uh certified by the american welding society and i've uh <sniff> uh that's probably the biggest achievement that i've made for you know myself an accomplishment um <clears throat> uh people that i know say that i'm uh well i haven't been working on cars lately but they said that i have a natural knack for uh restoration and working on vehicles and i don't see it but i've been told that once or twice but i i've kind of i i've kind of started to slip away from that i don't i can't say it's from lack of interest but i just don't feel the motivation no more i wish i had a pocket of money and i'd have somebody else to it that's how i feel <laughter> okay well thank you bye bye,1
