301,thank you mmm k i'm doing good thank you i'm from los angeles oh great i live in west los angeles the west side it's alright i xxx no i live alone so i love it i'm from here so i grew up here it's natural the weather um well the weather it's always good it's never it's never bad uh um there's always something to do it's rarely a dull moment the traffic the traffic is horrible well probably traffic is horrible in almost any major city but i hate the traffic not really i mean i have enough things going on here so if i travel it's usually somewhere that's within driving distance i studied uh business i did no i've i've been done for a few years so i haven't gone to school for a while one of these days i'll go back to graduate school but my dream job would be to just work for myself and making lots of money um i don't know i don't really have a dream job just something that i can i can work under my own terms and get paid decently and and be in a creative creative environment um i don't know i think it's just a matter of finding the right situation so right now eh it's been people are a little conservative about what they want so and how they want it so it's a little tougher than it seems <se> it should be but i don't know i think when the situation's right i don't think it's too difficult yep i work as an assistant <as> administrative assistant through a temp agency so it's just basically i get sent out to do uh to do desk jobs  um yes and no i mean i feel like i feel like i could do more but you know it works so  you know yeah i'm pretty close i mean they're around so um god really mad stupid people just basically doing just doing anything to annoy me um that's basically <ba> that's the big thing just just irritating stupid people <laughter> who just do things just to provoke provoke me for no reason at all um what's a good example just random people who who think it's funny to just sit there and get a rise out of me just it doesn't have to be one any specific situation it's just people who just think it's funny to i think they're just generally sadistic and they just think it's it's funny to to just prod you like it's like poking a stick at an angry dog knowing that they know how to they just wanna push your buttons for no reason so uh god i don't remember i with those situations i usually try not to remember <laughter> when when it happens i just i just let it go and just like the past is the past i just tend not to look back what do you mean okay god what do i do to relax i like to run i like to go to the gym listen to music i have a lot of musician friends so i just so i'm usually around musicians so anything of that sort i like i like everything from punk rock art to tattoos to just anything that's that's generally art and creative who's been a positive <pos> i think it's just friends in general who who seem to who seem to do well and i think they they're very inspiring and which is sometimes a a bit tough in in a town like los angeles where i think everybody's on the go trying to accomplish their own goals so they don't it's sometimes hard to find someone who's gonna be uplifting or try to be inspiring so i don't really have anybody in particular but people have kind of brought up things here and there you know just like hey instead of instead of doing this how about doing that or hey you're good at this why aren't you doing that or something like that just you know i'm always looking for new opportunities so they always point out things that maybe i might i could do differently instead of just being negative saying hey don't do that that's no that's why are you doing that it's a waste of time um i guess it depends on who you talk to i'm i'm okay at it i could probably work at that um i don't know i mean i can i i think i can do better at it well back to the point about people provoking me so i mean i try not to blow steam and let them get under my skin so i just usually try not to let it get to me but i don't know i guess with temper i guess it depends on how i handle my stress lately i've been better at it just because i think my situation's been a little bit better no no no um nothing major i mean maybe when i was younger i could've traveled more or i could've worked towards something that paid better job-wise but i mean those are all things that i think at any point in life you always think like well i coulda shoulda would've done but you know but then again i think that's natural for anybody i mean i could i could've become a banker or i could've become a lawyer or a doctor and made about ten times the money that i make now but but then again i don't like the law and i don't like medicine so so i'm it wasn't meant to be so yeah so um i think i think my in my life i knew that i there's a lot of things i have <ha> there's more dislikes <laughter> than likes so i kinda narrowed it down to what am i good at and what am i not good at and what am i gonna work well or who who am i gonna work well with and who will i not work well with so i kind of i kinda sorted out and then the list kind of mmm kind of answered itself so no it i don't think it was hard but it was just but i think it was a real reality check and i think it it's kind of a good thing 'cause sometimes trying to conform to doing things that doesn't really fit you doesn't make sense it's like trying to shove a a round peg into a square a square hole and it's like it just no matter how you try to shove it in it's not gonna go in so sometimes it's just might as well go down a path that seems to work better for you memorable experiences um hmm i think it's just i don't really have like any one in particular i think i think every day is almost like a memorable experience whether it's positive or negative i think it's just everything from getting it just just the fact that i got a job and i can i can take care of myself is already almost like a memorable experience maybe for the average person it it sounds stupid but you know i think just the fact that i'm able i'm able to get this far in life without like completely self-destructing is already an accomplishment so i feel like i've gotten somewhere maybe not to not maybe not to the point to the average person they might think like well why aren't you a millionaire but you know what not everybody can be a millionaire yeah um when was the last time i really felt happy um i don't know i'm not really someone who's like i don't have any real high highs or low lows i mean i haven't hit any lows so i mean i i don't know i'm usually pretty i feel like i'm a level person and i'm pretty happy <ha> every day i feel like if i accomplish one thing then i'm pretty happy so i guess to answer the question probably mmm probably yesterday i just feel like if i if i'm able to accomplish something then then hey i'm happy i don't know i don't really have a best friend but i mean i well to answer the question generally friends i think they would say that i'm very <ver> pretty outgoing i'm pretty determined i'm trying you know i try to you know i try to interact as much as possible i'm always out networking as much as possible so i don't know i guess that's basically what i think they would describe me as okay no problem alright bye,0
302,i'm fine how about yourself  i'm from los angeles california what part  okay  um all my family's here friends a mixture of people and a lot of things to do early childhood education no not right now but i would love to get back into it love working with kids seeing them smile um guess it goes back to when i was a kid uh i like being happy and playful so i guess it just transferred into my adult life working with kids as a school teacher or in that capacity yeah it is but if it's a passion of yours it'll always be fun i'm very close sometimes too close um i have four sisters and one brother on my mom's side and on my dad i have six brothers and four sisters and we're all getting intertwined together so so that's why i say we're too close sometimes no i have a lot of friends to interact with and uh we're always doing different things so that's why i say i'm not curse <laughter> just let it out a couple days ago my nephew didn't call me back um kinda mad 'cause i had set aside some time to spend with him and he just blew it off and didn't call me back yeah i know mm i'm okay when my mother passed uh it's been about five years now to the day so it's it's getting better time makes it easier a lot 'cause there's a lot of things that make me think about her in a daily basis anything uh driving by a particular restaurant that she likes uh watching different t_v shows just anything that could trigger a a memory of my mom yesterday uh think about the good times and i don't stay in that place too long just go ahead and think about it and move on mm not officially but i think i might be depressed well i mean since my mom passed it's been kinda rough and then um job situation is not stable here in california so that has a lot to do with it as well so yeah it is but kinda sort of kinda just to myself reserved  mm not really it's pretty easy grumpy irritable fidgety just a big ball of nerves  uh what do you mean uh i guess so yeah i like to travel meeting new people different locations scenery uh different opportunities to try something new in a new location uh just came back from memphis about three weeks ago go and see family and friends uh it was pretty nice got a chance to see um something new change <cha> change of scenery wow stick to the plan and don't veer off to the left or right just go straight ahead um  just different circumstances in life that gradually pushed me towards the left and the right every day uh a few relationships not staying in school um missing out on great opportunities with employers um funny loyal spontaneous life of the party grew up together in the same community went to school together high school friends uh my big sister michelle uh my friend troy um i mean there's others but those two uh no matter good or bad they're always in my corner for me thank you yesterday <yester> yesterday celebrated a birthday oh it was just a little small intimate setting  cooked a a meal had family and friends over listened to music watched movie talked about the old days when my mom was here and when we were all one union so it was just a nice evening thank you bye bye,0
303,okay how 'bout yourself here in california yeah oh well that it's big and broad there's a lot to do a lot of um um job opportunities than other states um pretty much that it's big and there's a lot you can do here traffic um maybe the violence rate bad news even though you know you wanna know what's going on in your environment but you still have to watch it so you can you know look out to see what's going on on a daily basis sociology i have a um two year degree in liberal arts but my major was sociology no i'm actually an m_t_a bus operator well since metro is steady growing um my dream job is to move up in the company and i'm about to actually start some classes for supervisory next week so um 'cause they look to promote within the company so that's the good thing there's a lot of opportunities at metro where you can take classes and they'll pay for your tuition and things of that nature thanks well it's not actually hard as right now it's easy if you take advantage of it right now 'cause they look to promote within so you know so since i'm already working there that's a good thing so it's good to go ahead and take the classes that you need that you're interested in and go ahead and move up the ladder as soon as possible  what do you mean i'm sorry okay read take a long walk hot bath meditate just close my eyes sometimes i'm pretty much good because see by me being a bus operator you run into circumstances and situations you gotta remain calm and still remain professional at the same time well i look at it like it it goes with i mean it comes with experience you know um you do something on a continuous basis usually you some somewhere down the line you become good at it you know so i i look at it like that so i've been driving for years and dealing with the public so it's just how you handle circumstances you you know treat people like you wanna be treated no i'm pretty good at it now maybe when i was younger you know you as you get older you get wiser you learn different things and i'm still learning today i would say my family you know my kids you know even though you know i had been having a lot of deaths around me but that's just go that's part of the life experience you know you born here but you gotta leave here one day but my kids will keep me you know sane and you know i love them and my family   thank you no <laughter> um setting good examples you know because you're the first teacher you know and you wanna set a positive good example for your kids and i think that's a good thing and it starts at home well um by you being the first teacher your kids you're you're their one that they see on a daily basis when they wake up so whatever's been taught in the home they lookin' and learning every day you know whether it's a home school you know people kids have a tendency to do things what they see you know what i mean  so you try to keep it positive teach 'em good morals and values and how to get along with other people regardless of race and you know different things of that nature i have a um four and a half year old son i have a seven year old daughter and i also have a twenty three year old yeah i'm 'bout to be well my daughter's pregnant with a boy she has three um little girls so i have three grandkids and um one on the way which is a boy this time yeah thank you the hardest thing is well right now i'm a single parent so that makes it hard alone itself you know and they can be expensive at times you know it depends on the person's situation you know the whether they have help or a job you know things of that nature to help the situation better but it's hard you know but you i try to you know keep a job keep food in the house you know just maintain and support my kids the best way i can with my kids or just period what's memorable for me is that i'm the only one in my family with a degree so it's kinda like yeah it's kinda even though i'm the baby of ten kids you know and i've always kept that in the back of my mind even though everybody well pretty much my whole family have decent job but i'm the only one with a degree so i kinda like gave myself a pat on the back like you know you know i just that's the only thing i remember graduating you know and my family there and to support me  thank you happy that i accomplished something you know just even though it may not be much but it was better than just have having a high school diploma and i had um i was working on my bachelor's degree but i ended up in a bad car accident i never went back i got distracted and you know i was working at the same time but i was just like moreso i needed income than than um schooling at that time because i was a young parent you know 'cause i had my daughter at seventeen so i was like i needed the money to support her but i never went back but i feel like it's never too late so i feel like i'll take some classes now that i'm with metro to help me move up the ladder so  that's why i'm starting a class next week thank you hm well the advice i would've gave myself that i probably wouldn't have been a young mother at a young age and that i probably would've stayed in school you know not let the accident just distract me and not i would've remained in school i probably wouldn't have had kids early you know um rather i probably would've stayed in school and probably have a part time job or something just i just feel like um education is a excellent thing for a person just having knowledge and learning different things keeping your mind open to learning new ideas every day so i think that's a plus you know in anybody's shoes just to better they selves you know through education maybe to um maybe promote within your company or whatever the case may be that they help better your career i'm not quite sure um you learn from your mistakes you know but at the same time you don't continue to make the same ones i feel like it's okay to make a mistake but long as you do something to change you know um like myself even though i'm going to school late but still i'm going you know i wanna better myself career wise so  yes my oldest daughter we had a argument because just the life that she's living right now and the things that she's going through and um i had told her that she just needed to make some changes to better her situation and uh we got into an argument because you know how your kids sometimes don't wanna hear it you know hear the stuff that you're saying even though it's true or  or they just you know well they just don't wanna hear it you know they may be going through something they don't wanna hear but we got into a argument about it but that just happened you know i just told her i'm not i'm sorry very close very close it's just that the the situation my daughter's in she just needs to make some changes to better her her life and I'll be telling she's um she's kinda like stubborn in her own way you know i was raised to listen to your mom you know your mom's not gonna tell you nothing wrong and i've been telling her over the years you know different things and it's it's kinda like i was talking to a wall because she she did the opposite and now she's she regretting it you know 'cause she's like my mom told me this you know mom i'm doing the opposite so i guess she gotta bump her head a couple of times to get it it's kinda like i done told you i done left it alone and now it's up to you to make the change it's very frustrating because it's like i'm talking to a wall and she's not hearing me and i'm like it seem like it's taking forever for her to change but it's left up to the individual whenever they're ready you know what i mean once the person get tired of something they'll make it change it may not be when you want it to happen but the ball is her court you know i only can do so much oh wow i have my days um since i have two little ones um i kinda like trained them to go to bed at eight o clock because you know they gotta go to school and i think it's important to have a good night's rest because it kinda like <clears throat> it it kinda like gets you ready for the next day or you know how you gonna feel if you rested what type of person you'll be that day you know 'cause everybody have they days whether they're good or bad but that's just a part of life and i feel like if you had a good night's good good night's rest hopefully you'll have a good day you know pretty much you know i need my rest because i'm out there driving that bus and dealing with all these people and you know  the job itself if very stressful so i feel like if i'm rested it'll help me what am i like irritated tired um lazy you know feel like i wanna lay down probably go to sleep <laughter> get the rest that i need but <laughter> i never thought about that i just you know 'cause like i said you know everybody have their moments they do i never thought about that hm no no i don't really have a best friend but a person that i deal with and i used to work with um she would probably tell you that i'm very um outgoing a go getter dependable responsible i'm a um people person i get along with others you know i'm kinda like um i leave a good a a good mark whether i know you or not if you was to you know like  like you and i now you know i um you'd probably say oh she seems like a nice young lady or whatever you know something like that thank you well i try to stay happy i'd rather be happy than sad my kids keep me going you know what i mean especially when i go to pick them up from school or their being hey mom you know that just kinda make my day just them run up to me you know and be happy and excited you know what i mean  thank you you're more than welcome you have a good day goodbye,0
304,i'm doing good um from los angeles california um the cool weather the beaches the people the schools  um child development yes to be a teacher for special education it's not hard 'cause i love to work with children yes dishonesty maybe um like if a guy like especially when it comes to relationships when they lie to you about something that's very minimal my mom i wanna say my mom um very close we talk every day very close even though i don't live with them i try to see them as much as i can uh it's okay <laughter> it's it's good it's yes i do  um they're they're friendly it's just that they're very quiet 'cause i'm not used to that environment it's fine like the how much it costs is very cheap so that's good and they're friendly so it's fine I just wish it was a little bit it could've been better so yeah  yes <laughter>  um i had a different option to live with somebody else and i'm still friends with the female and comes to find out that we connect more than the roommates that I live with so I kinda regret moving in with the roommates I have now versus who i was supposed to move with in the beginning so but i'm stuck for a year so it's whatever  that's fine how do i know who i yeah <laughter> there's nothing that really gets me really mad that i can think of the top of my head um um maybe when it comes to schools how they treat the children especially children of color maybe  that really gets me mad mm yes  because i do things from within i guess so um internally motivated to do things i guess yeah yeah wow i hardly ever argue with somebody <laughter> yeah oh my sister i guess my sister that was about a month ago uh i felt very betrayed and belittled because she's my little sister and she shouldn't be disrespecting me in any type of way because i'm an adult so yeah i was not feeling the situation at all um just her getting into grown folks' business and it was a conversation between me and my mother and i guess she overheard what was being said and she felt like through my actions that i was choosing somebody else over my family when that wasn't even the case but because she didn't know the whole situation she just automatically assumed and put stuff on facebook about me disrespecting me calling me out by name and it was just yeah so <laughter>  and she then comes to me about it like she did all this other stuff on facebook i don't that's one thing i don't like either is when you i hate indirect comments like if you have if you need to talk to me come directly to me don't put it on facebook tell other people that's a pet peeve of mine so i really don't like that yeah so but i mean we're fine now so that's good yeah to not  believe people so easily so gullible to not be so gullible i guess i've been hearing that lately how i believe anybody anything that somebody says without really thinking about it or without having them prove it so i guess you could say i let i made a lot of mistakes i don't wanna say i regretted it because i'm glad i went through it while i was younger than me getting older and going through the same situations so um yeah i believe people too easily and i give people too much chances  so yeah when i went on a cruise which was a happy experience when i went on a cruise to mexico with my family um  when i was sixteen about six years ago yeah <laughter> yeah i mean yeah i guess it was <laughter> no i really want to though um trying new things seeing new views of the world um trying the different type of foods um seeing how the government is and how they run the things out there i guess um yeah i plan to go to the bahamas next year i plan to do a lot of traveling next year actually so yeah it's pretty good eh somewhat i'm tired <laughter> and i kind of fall asleep during class and whatnot yeah it's my fault though um probably today yeah well i fell asleep late so <laughter> it's my fault um no i feel pretty happy right now mhm no no no very friendly and funny talkative um through high school  we're pretty close we try to talk as often as possible maybe once a week i'll try to see them at least every few months mm they're everywhere <laughter> um yeah no comment on that they're more smarter they are learning more stuff than we learned back in the day they are learning they're very progressing but when it comes to technology they're not outside they're always on the computer on their phones they don't play outside no more they don't care about nature or the little things in life they just yeah but when it comes to their mentality they argue smarter 'cause the schools are getting better i ain't gonna lie so  when what happened i was just okay um last weekend i guess right now um  what did i do um being with my boyfriend makes me really happy so i was just hanging out with him last weekend and i never really get to see him that much so yeah   'cause he works i have school different schedules it's not that bad <laughter> um he's my boyfriend i've been knowing for what about six months now  we met through a mutual friend um  in l_a i guess okay you're welcome bye,0
305,i'm doing alright uh originally i'm from california uh born in glendale i'm not too happy with it uh just unemployed at the moment but uh actively seeking uh uh doing what i'm supposed to be doing uh there are some uh  some prospects there but hopefully i'll learn something today yeah well i have one it's a girlfriend so i consider her a roommate a lover type thing pardon me um we're pretty close uh i met her last year and uh we've been through some troubling times but uh we're starting to see a light at the end of the tunnel uh the troubling times uh i would let me see uh well i had uh gotten a d_u_i last year and uh lost my job i'm a truck driver by trade so  uh that kinda threw me way off uh having a fourteen hundred dollar a week job uh and then going to nothing kinda like plus losing my my license kinda really threw me off and uh I couldn't um i haven't really uh found anything that i was interested in uh so i started cooking and our trying to see which other route i can go as far as uh having some kind of a career and uh so i'm choose choosing to go into the culinary field but you know uh meanwhile i still have to work it's hard to find work with uh without going to school  and uh so but i think today uh i applied at ralphs so hopefully i'll get that job i should have that job actually so um but i'm starting to see a light like i said at the end of the tunnel now a little by little my dream job would be probably forestry service out in the wilderness yeah i like being alone pardon me well you know i have a a lot of for animals i'm an exotic animal trainer by trade and uh so and i like  being i don't like people too much uh so being outdoors and uh i've always enjoyed being outdoors that's how i like being a truck driver i've traveled the world i don't necessarily like being in a warehouse or an office i'm of a a outdoors type of guy so uh one of my trips would be uh i spent a year and a half in japan and uh on the uh lower island uh there that uh they built that bridge  uh the largest bridge in the world uh and uh i went there to work for  uh for an all white oh uh an all white tiger act and uh working for a japanese circus  so it was interesting that a lot of people on that island hadn't really seen a lot of americans  'cause that was also one of the islands that we uh that they bombed  so there was a lot of negativity but i i pretty have a good idea out you know outlook uh on life uh especially during those times you know i i enjoyed myself you know through all the traveling and and meeting new people and um eating you know different um diverse foods and uh it was a good experience for me  all of that whole experience was pretty good for me you know just traveling around with circuses and uh  you know it's been great uh probably um one some of the things i like about l_a there's not a lot that i like about l_a but um i like hollywood i like the the the movie industry um the uh huge uh um different different people you know different uh different ethnics of uh people here you know uh i enjoy talking to uh few you know a lot of foreigners you know i like to see where they came from and and what what it's like there  traffic's atrocious you know traffic <laughter> uh ignorance uh being disrespected uh being disrespectful or whatever you know other people being disrespectful toward you or other people um that's about it dishonesty pardon me uh it happens on a daily basis it seems like you know i ride the bus a lot so uh you know or i if i'm riding my bike uh people tend to almost run me over so if i'm not totally paying attention to traffic uh you know i find myself sometimes you know having to wait to see what they're gonna do instead of i having the right of way or uh something like that yeah big time what do i do when i'm annoyed um probably sit there and uh sit there and vent you know uh speak my mind even though a lot of times it's i'm myself you know just like you know assholes or whatever you um well you know i carry rocks in my back pocket so i can it you know it happens so much where i i just it just amazes me at what people will do sometimes you know you almost get run over all you know i i probably almost get run over probably on a daily basis   and if i wasn't paying attention i'd be up shit creek uh it's hard with dealing with people especially trying not to react 'cause there's consequences for your reactions um it was with my girlfriend and uh it was about being honest uh  um i'm pretty honest with i'm open and honest about any anything and everything and uh what it was about was uh just her lying to me uh telling me that she had told our landlord something and and that she had done something and that and that aspect and i come to find out a week later that it was a total lie so i just you know didn't like that at all pardon me um i'm trying to i'm missing the word for it uh just that i don't know now that whether i could believe anything she says now so it was it was uh i felt hurt you know uh that you know here we had been in a relationship for a little bit and well that's probably one of my biggest uh pet peeves is is being honest  um i don't like i said i don't hold back and i'm pretty honest in anything and everything that i do or say so you know and if you're lying about something well you just you're always having to cover up uh more lies with the lies that that you already told and i just don't see any you know so it kinda took a lot from uh me trusting her now or you know whatever now i'm i you know is it truthful is it not you know so it's kinda hurt our relationship can't do nothing about it uh fun i like going to the beach uh i love shooting darts but i haven't done it in a while i i love i love to paint uh i got into watercolor painting  and i'm pretty gifted at that and um uh i wanna try some other mediums and uh let's see here i love fishing uh haven't gone in a while though and uh i like driving a truck you know uh it's you know my job you know i was a i really really enjoyed it i don't like driving through cities but uh usually when i'm in the middle of the night where i can see all the stars i like star gazing i'll see if i can um pick out some of those uh astronomy uh stars up up there and um  i'm a pretty easy going guy so shooting pool um sunshine just those i like uh most memorable experiences um good or bad uh most memorable experiences uh probably uh playing with lions and tigers uh uh wrestling a a baby elephant in a in a mud puddle uh uh just enjoying myself i know not uh i don't have much family as it is uh at least here in the states i don't my mom's from central america so uh  but i'm not close to i have uh  three brothers one sister and i'm probably not really really close to none of my siblings i speak with one brother uh quite a bit um my other youngest brother you know he he just i'd just rather not  you know i converse <con> converse with him but it's you know just i try to keep it on a professional basis my sister i don't talk to at all my my other brother underneath me i haven't spoken to him in years so i'm just close with my mom uh my niece some of my nephews and that's about it have i done anything to avoid it um to avoid them uh yeah i just don't talk to them i don't call them i don't ask about them i you know i talk to my mom quite a bit my brother quite a bit but i just don't bring up those subjects or if they are brought up i just usually say you know that's on them and i really don't wanna deal with them so um it's been hard lately it's been probably hard for the last uh going on a year um you know i uh depends on my thought process at the time i like i said i've been looking for work quite a bit um so just wondering why you know i don't get called i i just have my i have racing thoughts  so  or i get depressed you know 'cause i or i worry about things that you know that really i have no control over so i don't lately i just been sleeping a bit too much uh at least for me because i'm so used to just sleeping four to five hours a a a night but now it's changed to about eight to nine hours and i'm still tired uh lately i have been probably about the last few months um tired <laughter> um i you know if i don't sleep well sometimes then i just dwell back on the same things that have been bothering me so you know i'm more of a guy you know i love to work um and if i'm not then it's just a little bit too much time for me to spend in my own head and so you know um i there i either if i'm busy or i'm doing what i you know in whatever job i do i kinda you know get to it i enjoy it uh it's something new for me and uh so i can think about you know either work or i think of home and then think about this you know i don't have to worry about you know um money um you know bills are getting paid and i can just concentrate on other things either you know do the things i like or mm you know maybe spending a little bit more time with my girlfriend or you know so something like that  how do i what how do i cope with them um i just try not to think about it uh it's it's not about whether coping with it or not um i just do it's uh i'm more of a guy that just you know it may take me a moment to to um say that i'm coping with something but you know it it's if i have no control over it there's nothing that i can really do about it the only thing i can do is control to do what i'm doing and that's actively looking for work uh actively going out on uh  interviews uh talking with others about work so that i can just kinda you know get back to um back to basics you know i just don't let a lot of stuff bother me it does bother me but i try not to to let it continue to bother me if what has gotten me in trouble my mood swing i mean um yeah money i mean you know my past i i got a past history so uh which kinda tends to uh uh bother my uh my hiring process i don't know if i'm gonna get hired so i gotta deal with uh different different type of employers who are uh say uh felony friendly and uh uh stuff like that and i try you know i i've taken classes on uh  on uh how to interview how to uh how to answer some of the questions which you know come up quite a bit and uh i kinda reflect back on that but i just uh i gotta keep putting to my head that that's not who  who i wanna be anymore so or you know i i've done  uh i've done uh i've done my time uh so to say but uh i took the time you know the last time i just took a lot of time and  and try to uh work on the issues that were bothering me so um you know toward positive stuff i got my g_e_d different things a lot of classes um uh thought about going to school  i didn't go to school and uh anything that would kinda um change my old ways and and uh and try to move on to more productive activities  pardon me i still didn't hear you that people have been deceitful can you repeat that one more time alright uh i've been diagnosed with uh bipolarism um it's tough if you don't you know um i don't medicate so i mean i have been on medication before  in the past but <sniff> um again it's i try to live on life uh i try to live life on life's terms  and i just you know um i know the medical establishments always wanna label something and  and what i don't like about it is that they just experiment with pills you know i've been on probably every imaginable pill that there is for that and um you know some of them have been too strong or some of them not strong enough and so i just try to cope with things uh um it's just my life skills you know i i don't i don't wanna be using drug i know certain drugs work for like three to four months six months  and then they go well here i'm gonna try you on this and or i'm gonna try you on that  and it's just an ongoing process and i probably for about the last two years actually about three years i kinda just said you know what that's it and um whether it's different than whether if i would be on on on uhon meds for it   um i don't think so you know it's the still the same stuff i still get the same problems and i still  uh get the same anxiety as if i if i was on medication for it or not so i just and i'll deal with it you know sometimes it's not good you know i get irritated at people a lot i don't like people um i don't like crowds i don't you know like obnoxious people huge empty quiet so um but i i get a person you know i it's not that personality but i think people can see me and just say uh don't mess with this guy or you know um but still you know i like i i ride public transportation quite a bit and um you know you just get a lot of loud obnoxious people on there sometimes i gotta get off the bus that's how i deal with with with with people because i just know there's consequences if i if i didn't deal with it that way  so i just let it go i'd rather take the time on getting off the bus waiting for the next bus and hopefully it's not that bad  did i have a problem before i got out uh well i  i don't know if i knew that i had a problem um uh before i found out the thing is that i know other people  um i have a lot of ups and downs so i know a lot in my younger days people would tell me you know when i told them that i was diagnosed with you know bipolar that um  a lot of remarks were like oh that's what's wrong you know that's what was wrong with you we we wish that you would've would've found that out years ago  uh and uh like i don't think the meds really work but what i do uh i think uh time kinda like you know just getting older kind of uh you know makes it work you know me me dealing with life so pardon me uh i talked to a therapist probably on a weekly basis for a while uh recently and uh it helps a lot you know uh just to get out my anger uh my thoughts um a lot of people may not understand that but uh a therapist is i think the bigger thing is that i can just get it all out uh whatever's bothing me whether it be uh people you know uh uh other issues you know were whatever the case may be  i just think talking about it and they're such good listeners and can kinda like you know they they give me the same advice that you know that i you know give myself or whatever that i would give to others uh but it's always helpful if you hear it from somebody else somebody who will be has a you know are are you know they go to school for this so  you know but it's good to have yeah well i don't go anymore uh so um i kinda miss it you know like i said uh uh i miss it a lot actually but uh it's just one of those things you know i just deal with it you know uh according to you know if i ever get a chance to go to therapy again i probably will um well monetary reasons and uh you know uh i don't have health insurance there's a lot of things that you know i'd like to do but i can't you know um  you know money situation's not that great right now so how does my friends describe me um they would probably describe me as uh uh energetic uh outgoing person uh once i get to know people um laughs i you know i laugh a i laugh a lot um but uh they would probably tell you that i'm also very serious and uh  uh hidden person i don't reveal a lot you know and uh so  someone who has been a positive influence in my life someone who's been um someone who's been a positive influence in my life uh probably my boss one of my bosses uh when i first started with uh with exotic animals he was real you know he was uh uh german and um they didn't teach i don't know what he saw in me but he taught me a lot about working with exotic animals and um showed a lot of confidence in me and which in in it also built confidence in myself  and uh sort of let me know that you know that there's nothing that i really can't accomplish if i put my mind to it you know yeah it was you're welcome bye <laughter>,0
306,fine uh colorado mhm uh career career possibilities uh paralegal uh for further education for the weather for a friend [laughter]  not often at all now every few years oh the weather uh the beach sunsets at the beach uh the thought of uh career possibilities um an educated group of people sophisticated market it is an adjustment uh to to come here a lot of people misjudge it a little bit it's a laid back appearing town but it's actually very um uh sensitive to you know uh success and commericalization and that kind of thing so you have to keep up the pace uh that is a little bit harder i think when you first make the adjustment and pretty soon it becomes obvious that it's another market that you just have to work hard in like you you do in others oh be an attorney [laughter] mhm oh just because you have the uh the power you can use uh you know skills to be able to affect people live people's lives in a more dramatic way than just being uh an assistant in that field oh uh a lot of it is not around anymore just have brothers and sisters out of state so not particularly close right now uh mm dishonesty unkindness  lack of sympathy uh insensitivity you know uh very good if anything i'm i'm uh regressive that way [laughter] mhm oh wow uh oh just a friend a friend who is who is right now a has a fabulous job is uh spending too much money that he needs to save uh through uh a work situation just a a work connection  mutual friends mhm uh close close now we spend time we have uh we go out and have fun sometimes uh walk walk on the beach uh you know uh shop in beach areas is kind of fun rodeo drive occasionally and uh and see films art art galleries oh uh my daughter i just have one daughter who graduated u_c_l_a law school and uh i raised her totally alone without any help so it seemed like an accomplishment that was was worth it the the two jobs and the work uh i think it's difficult i think it's a difficult job that takes a lot more work than most people give it credit for if you wanna do it right you know it's always second guessing your behavior and that kind of thing uh just uh i'd say peer pressure it can totally alter [al] alter anything a parent has tried to put into a child that's good scrubbed_entry so that was a really bad time for us um i think it depends on which neighborhood or state you're in or the the uh i i think they're a little misguided i think a little uninspired [unin] uninspired right now i think they're being weighed down by the concerns of the wars and um and things like that and i think they can probably use a  uh a common goal a common you know now a team uh as as oppposed to just being more separated group than a family [fam] once they were i think you know kind of uninspired right now um i worry sometimes about you know work issues but it's pretty pretty easy um no i i don't feel like i'm not sleeping i i just you know will occasionally worry about something at work oh gosh about a couple weeks ago oh just uh you know unfortunately we have to worry you know i'm fortunate this isn't easier it's just cooperation between people uh it solves most everything you know so you always wanna have that around you um just stressed yeah stressed more stressed mhm um yeah fatigue has uh a lot of uh you know a lot of implications for just not feeling like yourself or misjudging things that you might judge differently if you were more well rested uh not depression um probably yeah i was that was considered a possibility i had an employment lawsuit several years ago and and uh actually litigated it and won the settlement um something about whistleblower thing implications [im] implications of that and um and i was kind of harrassed about it and so i found when i got out of it i couldn't find work right away in my own field so i had to go into a different field go back to u_c_l_a and get a new uh professional direction and i found myself fearful sometimes that it's gonna happen again you know and you think that would never happen again you know um just that i was noticing that i was noticing i was feeling very uh in my paralegal class i had a a section about employment law and there was a a very complicated filing i had done with great a deal of work and study for my case but once faced with it again in that class setting i just i just couldn't get it done it was a late paper from me and i realized i was traumatized by having to go through that again um that you know yeah post traumatic stress sometimes comes later after the adrenaline dies down from what i understand and um so i think it was just uh it was just hitting me later you know that i was having to face that paper again and wow you know no adrenaline just wow there is a xxxx back back just uh just extreme uh you know avoidance of getting something done that should've been easy for me  and uh and thinking about it as thoroughly as i should've or studying it or putting it off uh putting the feeling of going through that paper that type of paper even if it's just a class assignment again you know well um not lately um you know back then for sure when that happened which was about ten years ago now it was settled in court about seven years ago now and uh yeah it was it was effective you know it was effective in the way you view most everything and in your confidence and that kinda thing i'm sorry [laughter] repeat the question uh peaceful do i feel peaceful well yeah i was peaceful that it that it's settled uh but but angry that it ever happened so it's hard to i'll probably not ever feel peaceful about that issue ever it always the mention of it always makes me angry that i had to go through that yeah i don't think so i tried everything to avoid it [laughter] you know and so uh uh i think that's that was aggravating for me too because i'm a patient person realistic and um and i tried everything to avoid uh confrontation in the matter but it was just required to try to you know help me cover the damage to our lives my daughter's life i uh not now maybe one time in my life not now you if you can't communicate uh you know if you could communicate you could overcome people's perceptions or their judgments of you if you can effectively explain something and and uh it will help you overcome other perceptions of yourself that others might normally have judgments for age or anything like that um well just raising a daughter extendedly you know or or uh you know just um the experience of thinking thinking that that was a after all the years that was a success her graduating from law school yeah uh just like a lot of work had a good ending uh  you know happy glad that it was fulfilled wishes or or dreams for this child were fulfilled you know that and she was able to make that success wow um [laughter] i i i tend to be kind of happy with life 'cause the alternative is gonna harm harm your you know your ability to succeed so i try to force happiness i guess in in most every situation in my life route i find something about it uh when i lost some weight recently that made me really happy i travel a little bit locally i traveled more when i was younger i really enjoyed that but just been too busy in the last few years just new places um ability to take the worries we have every day work  or concerns and kind of put them away for a while and see something new  you know kind of the way i'm going back to uh colorado san riosco went through vale  and uh and spent the night there and um and it was just during spring when there aren't many skiiers and it was just beautiful and very quiet a lot of restaurants with the decks and open in the mountains and it was beautiful yeah wow uh just um ardent i'm hard working loyal uh um creative um just seeing something that you're creating you're trying to create uh becomes something you hoped the picture would be you know if if that's the case you know just hard work uh just fulfilled or or presented itself in a certain way that you know it makes you happy to my daughter um very [ver] pretty close she just had a baby she's in the bay area she send me pictures all the time okay bye,0
307,<laughter> um moscow um my family moved to the u_s and then i moved down here eventually for college  uh it took a long time to i've been living here for about a year since i graduated so there's been a lot of ups and downs but finally gotten adjusted to it so it took a while though it goes off and on i have two roommates and there's always a little bit of drama here and there between the girls but for the most part after a year and a couple months i think we finally learned how to live together but it was pretty much like a reality t_v show for a while one's from college and the other one we found on craigslist it varies depending on whether or not we're mad at each other so um i guess pretty close right now we're kinda distant oh about the distant okay um well we  haven't seen each other we haven't hung out in like two weeks 'cause one of them got into like this car accident and um so she's been distant since then and kinda locks herself up in her room and the other one is always working late so we just our our scheduling has been off and no one's really made an attempt to hang out with anyone so it's kind of we're just waiting for someone i guess to make the first move  it's okay it'll get better it depends with whom  i'm dealing with i guess i would say with some people i guess with my family not very good my boyfriend it's not very good but with other people that i might not know so well then i'm able to control it a little bit more but it'll be more passive aggressive than like full on anger oh 'cause i don't want them to see me as a bitch [laughter] yeah uh probably my best friend nicole she's probably been we've been best friends for like god since high school freshman year of high school is when we first met so long time so yeah um of of what  uh my friend nicole um we met in french class freshman year of high school we were in the same class and then we kinda started doing homework together and we had a lot of class the same classes together and so we just kinda started hanging out and then we just became closer and have stayed really close since then mhm um uh going out with friends going to bars going dancing biking hiking staying active um going to the movies going out to eat at restaurants uh photography um just hanging out with friends i guess whatever uh it varies like i'm really close to them when it comes to things about like school work um those kinds of things but when it comes to relationships and friendships and more personal personal things  i don't really discuss that with them so i guess superficially close but i rely on them a lot so we're close i guess mhm uh that's a good question um i guess it depends who it is again i guess people who are inconsiderate unthoughtful flakey ignorant and uh conceited [cons] uh yeah i guess those kinds of people and when people just um what makes me mad that's a good question i guess a lot of things make me mad [laughter] but it's mostly how people react to um different situations can make me angry i guess uh yesterday and it was my boyfriend and we argued because he's trying to be healthy and workout and save money  and so and so by doing that what he does is he orders pizza in so he's not saving money and he's not being healthy and so i got frustrated with him 'cause i'm constantly trying to push him to be healthy and each time he's like i'm gonna do it i'm gonna do it so he's constantly breaking promises that's another thing that makes me angry is people that don't follow through about other people or about myself or angry xxxx [laughter] um angry i guess i'll go with that no i don't feel angry often dang it that is a tough one how 'bout just getting paid to be me um i don't know that what i'm kind of trying to figure out right now 'cause i quit my full time job 'cause i hated it it was just mostly sitting in an office all day which i thought was extremely boring so now i work in a restaurant job and i'm trying to look for a second job to support myself um  my dream job i don't know what it would be but i know it would involve people and i'd love to have some kind of like finished product or some kind of accomplishment towards the end i guess it's something that i realized i like to see the result from all my hard work 'cause i majored in sociology and as much as i loved that major is you realize it's a whole lot of theorizing and arguing but with no real solution so it's just like at the end all you have is just these theoretical elements that you can't really do anything with and nothing to show for your work except for a piece of paper with your essays or notes so something to do with people and maybe something artistic i love photography i love cooking baking in particularly so i don't know something in that realm i guess i used to travel a lot my family is known for traveling we've gone to gosh seven eight different countries i've lived in three or four different countries i haven't traveled a lot lately just because i have no money and jobs kinda tie you down but i would love to have that i guess my dream job would be a photographer that for national geographic that would be awesome um or a huge photographer that travels that'd be awesome too but anyways um yeah i do travel a lot in the new places new faces new experiences i get restless very easily so it's nice to constantly be on the move and see different things and see different cultures and types of people and just not get stuck in the same routine i hate the routine and mundaneness of everyday life so it's nice to stir things up oh gosh okay um i'm trying to think one of my trips i guess we can talk about i don't know it's funny even though i've been to lots of different countries one of my most memorable memorable trips is one of the trips that i took with my family i was a three week roadtrip with my family there's five of us packed in a tiny little station wagon i know needless to say it's like when you're that close proximity for three weeks camping you start getting on each others' nerves but it was really fun and like even though i've traveled so many places i realized that there's like such a beauty in the american landscape and so we were all around the southwest and the grand canyon to zion to the grand tetons to yellowstone and it was absolutely amazing just seeing all that natural beauty so um and we saw a grizzly bear black bear lots of bison a wolf and it was really cool those kinds of i don't know natural wonders also really amaze me 'cause those things aren't man made and as as pretentious as it sounds after a while europe kinda gets not old but it's like you know you get the same idea like white old white men building great buildings and art work and it's beautiful and all but like you just kind of like okay i wanna see something that's natural and beautiful or something that's different too cool um pretty easy as long as I get well no i always sleep so easy oh grumpy and just very lethargic and just low energy don't say much and just kinda off in my own world i not not anymore i usually get enough sleep and i've been working out more so it's kind of  energizing me so no it's not too bad that's good uh i guess i've just been more negative but it has to do with like circumstances kind of like uh it's been about five months since i quit my full time job haven't found anything else haven't really found anything else i'm interested in so it's more of just like ugh what am i doing da da da that kind of thing yeah it's it is hard the market and just like i'm very picky 'cause i don't wanna just sittin in a little my own cubicle 'cause i quit my job exactly for that reason so why go back to another job just do the same exact thing that i quit my other job for so it's just like i have to make it worthwhile that i quit my last job to get a better job so it's just kinda like i'm stuck in this section of just like living paycheck to paycheck barely making it and just waiting for the right opportunity to come across but it's like when do i give up and sell my soul and go back to the corporate world of sitting in little cubicles i don't know yeah it is hard but i mean i guess everyone goes through that same situation after college so but i guess it's tough 'cause a lot of my friends 'cause i went to a pretty good school and you know i have a friend who's teaching english in afghanistan and i have another one who's met the president you know and one that's doing teach for america another friend who's in harvard uh school for like harvard masters [mass] you know getting her masters so it's kind of like ahh all that comparison and then here i am working a little restaurant job so uh i do sometimes yes but i'm going to hawaii next week so right now i'm fine [laughter] yes but yeah usually it's been kind of like down because i'm just trying to find like what i'm supposed to like you know what do i want to do next and like money situations which is very stressful especially when you have school loans to pay off insurance rent car loans like it's just groceries like i can't even afford groceries so it's just hard to like live this way especially after you've paid so much money for like an amazing college education so it's a little bit frustrating but there's a lot of people in the same situation it's all good uh no i don't think so but i mean i think everyone goes through depression here and there so i don't know if you can but not like medically diagnose i'm not on meds nope nope oh let's see uh to try lots of different things and not be afraid to fail 'cause i'm one of those people if i'm not gonna be the best at something then i'm just not gonna try i accept the best or nothing at all go big or go home so but i think i would've told my high school self that go and try lots of things even if it means i'm not gonna be the best at it so ten years ago well that would've made me like twelve so  [laughter] um i used to do a lot of things i i used to act i think i would've continued doing that i used to write a lot when i was younger i used to write miniature like little stories  short stories for my parents all the time and i kind of stopped doing those things 'cause it's like oh i'm not good at it so i'm not gonna do it and i think if i just continued doing those things and tried you know different classes  um i don't know different sports i kinda just stuck with soccer growing up i don't know just expand myself more rather than like find something i'm good at and just stay with it but never really try harder kinda just like stay i always kinda stayed at one level but once i'm good i just stay for good i don't try to go above that if that makes any sense uh right now it's super lame but i watch t_v [laughter] but i used to read a i used to read on my off time or just listen to music or just take a nap or bake but now it's just like since i'm on my feet all day and like constantly interacting with people i just kinda wanna unwind by like sitting and lying on the couch and being like i'm done so [laughter] that's a tough question um probably the day i got accepted into pomona college um i was a freshman at wellesley college which is the women's college back east and i hated it from like the second from like the first week i just knew that i chose the wrong college and i was like miserable for the entire year and i only only applied to one school to transfer pomona college like that's out in claremont and um i didn't think i was gonna get in and i was 'cause it was like a four percent acceptance rate and i was like what are the chances like this is ridiculous i don't think i'm gonna get in and i was like you know the thought of going back to wellesley was super depressing  um but then i got an email from one of the admission counselors that i had met when i was visiting pomona and he was like hi tatiana like um just wanted to see if you had any last minute questions about pomona hope all is well and i was like why would he be emailing me the day we find out if we got you know accepted or not um unless i got the acceptance and so sure enough a couple hours later i got the email that i was accepted into pomona and i was ecstatic that was like that best day of my life i was so happy that's probably one yeah it was awesome then i took my mom and my little brother out to dinner and i went and bought myself some new dresses went and just like went crazy dyed my hair pierced my nose i was like let's start this whole thing over so [laughter] yeah bubbly  fun  maybe moody you never know what you're gonna get sometimes um probably   uh definitely friendly um and pretty like a positive person um but sometimes maybe a little bit aggressive but for the most part i think positive things i mean she's my best friend so [laughter] huh  really happy oh when i was in mexico over winter well no i don't know my boyfriend took me on a sailing trip down in  san clemente

309,<laughter> <laughter> yeah <laughter> <laughter> i'm doing good  <laughter> uh arizona uh because of acting and other stuff like that entertain <entertai> enterainment industry no not at the moment at least um currently <curr> uh currently a student uh i produce hip hop uh well i rap and produce hip hop i play video games and then hang out with people no not very good i break things  uh on the way over here my mom and how to get here the beach <laughter> it's a fucking computer dude uh no the last place i went was los cabos <cabo> no not los cabos uh fuck where'd i go somewhere in mexico no no yes uh like four years ago right now no lately not very easy no just lately uh well my wife left like three weeks ago and after that i haven't been able to sleep uh i don't know i just bury me head in stuff i don't know i just do stuff i try to keep my mind off of it like do yoga and other things to keep my mind off of everything i don't have i never went to therapy wait no i did go to therapy like three four years ago 'cause i went to a separate therapist but then i went to a a thing where i they they did a bunch of uh cognitive tests <te> tests and memory tests and then she diagnosed me with a type of depression that lasts for a long time like i get depressed and it last for months on end yeah uh to be honest i don't know i think it's more about like you focusing on yourself and like i don't know i don't know how to explain that it's like you have to figure out things within yourself you don't need someone else to talk to well originally when i went to a therapist i was court ordered now i wanna go to therapy for my anger management though i don't know what the fuck <laughter> i mean my wife left like three weeks ago so yes <laughter> uh it's probably the hardest thing i've ever done so yeah well considering i'm only nineteen if i could go back nineteen years i would say not to fuck up and let myself get depressed about certain things that would've drove away my wife and not to be angry yeah driving away my wife <laughter> yes many many things every day <d> every day well i could've not broken stuff and i could've uh stopped uh like i was basically blocking out the external universe and i was putting everything into myself and like focusing on other things so that i don't focus on the real life i was basically escaping and so in that sense i wasn't paying attention to her and that's basically why she left i mean that and being angry 'cause like both contributed their own proportion their own portion earlier today uh i mean i feel really happy all the time and then it just like goes away it's like back and forth like one day i'll one second i'll be really happy and then another second i'll be really sad 'cause i'll think about something again and it's like i gotta keep my mind off of things and like move forward and like think and i don't really know how to explain it it's just something you feel no <laughter> you need better programming <laughter> <laughter> uh silly uh i'm creative uh uh potential of intelligence  i'm charming i'm loving at some points i'm all of those things some points i'm not doing yoga and playing video games and having my wife around my hip hop i mean kid travelier you need better programming <laughter> kid travelier is my friend  to be a hip hop artist  i don't know i just thought it one day not hard anymore i mean it was hard while i was practicing when i was younger when i was like eleven or twelve now it's just easy i'm still in school no problem yeah have a nice day bye bye,1
310,yes it's okay <laughter> fine <laughter> i live in hollywood uh seattle <laughter> uh it's kind of a vague question um <laughter> just needed a change of scenery uh i like traveling by train it's not my favorite thing uh because i don't fly i i can't stand airplanes so i prefer trains yeah <laughter> uh what uh flying on an airplane <clears throat> mm probably december of nineteen eighty six or eighty seven <laughter>  <laughter> uh it's nothing uh much to tell really my usually i just go from l_a up to seattle then up to vancouver that's probably the main thing i do so took the train <laughter> uh not very often so once every five years or so so oh yeah sure absolutely yeah  uh depends on what it is that i'm annoyed by could be anything depends <laughter> it depends on whether it's uh a something or a someone you know eh if it's a someone i mean i'm i don't i don't uh i don't get physical towards them but i mean i've <clears throat> depends on what they've done to piss me off i mean i'm certainly not above uh shouting at them for whatever reason so just depends uh in terms of lashing out at other people physically i don't do that but in order to let off some aggressions if if need be i'll i'm not above you know punching a wall or punching something nearby i just i mean i'm not trying to you know just as long as it doesn't physically hurt me but but i i you know just get some steam let off let off some steam well that's normal for me uh <sigh> face to face uh <sigh>  mm can't remember it's been a long time eh but i mean eh but i argue about with people online about stupid shit yeah and that's that's normal shit but as far as like face to face you know it's been a long time and <clears throat> currently or or overall which one i mean someone i'm in contact with now or someone from maybe from my past or which is it <clears throat> <laughter> okay uh my mom had a uh uh a boyfriend when i was a teenager he was like a father figure when i was about fourteen so he was a pretty positive influence <laughter> not at all to uh open up a record shop yeah uh i'm an unemployed office worker right now <laughter> as in what doing what be more specific <laughter> <sigh> going on a first date with a a girlfriend back in uh two thousand seven when we first met uh <clears throat> just made arrangements to meet her and her daughter and her daughter's friends at the queen mary in long beach and uh you know i had to cement the evening to cement the day and evening together uh hanging out and eating dinner and just ate at their hotel and yeah just got to know each other that way so  yeah it was yeah uh well we were that was the beginning of a relationship at the same so that was that's how i knew her you know she was my girlfriend at the time so <laughter> so currently yeah i do yeah uh i don't it sucks balls i hate to have roommates it sucks <laughter> <laughter> god <laughter> mm in some ways it's okay 'cause they don't see me that much 'cause i'm not really around them and other times i i need i need to have my own space you know so uh it's difficult for me that way but we get uh get along but i i don't really see them that much and that's by design so  <cough> <sigh> uh <sigh> i like to be alone sometimes i read but just mainly i i just like to be alone maybe maybe just doing nothing so just depends no no <clears throat> no i'm sorry you repeat that no not necessarily <clears throat> very i'm a heavy sleeper <clears throat> i don't know that i would call it down but i'm not necessarily what you would call you know cheery but i don't know that i'm necessarily down yeah yeah all the time <sigh> uh mm it's hard to say i i don't know i uh i'm not sure <clears throat> mm i don't know that i'm really one <on> the one to ask you know i think you <laughter> have to ask someone else about that you know i have a difficult time answering that question  <laughter> most proud of uh that i didn't didn't fall into drugs like a lot of other other people that i know yeah hmm <clears throat> listening to music on vinyl being around dogs mm uh spent new year's eve with a friend real close friend so <laughter> not really <laughter>  <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> i'm glad i don't have any i think they're uh especially here in los angeles i i they drive me nuts i can't stand them <clears throat> uh i assume you mean post-high school um uh briefly just took basic uh what did i take uh just general studies i from what i remember i i i i actually didn't finish i quit to uh uh go play in a band so i i i skipped a lot of school so i didn't really <laughter> you know so nothing uh it was a junior college <coll> or community college so it was i didn't go to university so i was just do what stop going i just wasn't interested <laughter> my interests were elsewhere so i just i just quit going you know so in terms of what oh sure everyone has regret over something you know i'm i'm not gonna get specific but yeah sure i <laughter> there are things i regret sure <clears throat> mm twenty years ago what was that ninety three oh mm well ten years ago uh two thousand and three hmm it's hard to say it's hard to say gonna <go> have to have to come back to that one maybe oh i don't have a best friend these days <laughter> i think it depends on your definition of friend uh i don't uh <clears throat> i don't hang out with too many people you know i had <ha> i had best i had a so-called best friend you know but that was like no <laughter> twenty year twenty some odd years ago you know i don't really i'm very much a loner these days so i i don't really have what you would consider a best or really close friend you know eh i just don't have that <laughter> okay see ya <laughter>,0
311,yes okay uh when'd i move to l_a um moved here a long time ago to live to go to work um well arizona and colorado i don't uh money don't have the money for it l_a's much nicer um <sigh> the people the movies uh the ocean uh when you wake up in the morning there's seagulls instead of birds just you know regular birds uh the roads <laughter> the roads really have a lot of potholes <laughter> <sniffle> yeah so it it wasn't hard to get used i i didn't like arizona at all it's really nice in l_a no what i do now um i sleep eat walk my dogs that's about it what'd be my dream job um i don't know uh screenwriter i guess um i understand it's pretty hard to write a good screenplay yes uh very well <sharp inhale> um well i didn't argue with a real person yes i have a person that i hear once in awhile and i talk to them and i had an argument about them listening on my phone uh avoidance whatever annoys me um being homeless yes it was um well they don't particularly like homeless people in l_a so it was <wa> it's really hard if you're homeless oh right now i live in an apartment uh i don't i don't like the neighbors um well they they harass you all the time so i don't come out of the apartment so <laughter> <sigh> uh well i didn't know when i moved there that they were horrible people so and i've complained to management but they don't do anything about it they just tell me to move yes um back in the nineties uh crying all the time yeah yeah uh yes yes i was in the hospital um uh two months ago for fifteen days um i was in there for depression for arguing with uh a person that's not real i ignore the person when i hear them and uh it's not hard anymore it was before i was going to therapy oh it's helped me uh be more cheerful and uh ignore things that bother me uh sleeping all the time eating too much uh tie arguing screaming at this unreal person um before i found out no uh lately i've still been pretty depressed yes very hard well i wake up about every two hours to go to the bathroom and um or i uh something wakes <wa> some noise wakes me up so i don't sleep well and i'm tired all the time mm don't remember um ah spending time with my dog or dogs i have two dogs so mm can't think of anything uh i try hard uh i have no idea <laughter> i don't know yeah uh my kids i have two kids a girl and a boy um the kids <laughter> they're great so uh trying to get them to do the right thing uh trying to get them to stay in school no um well you try to do the right thing and um it doesn't always work out yes oh well pretty close um what do i think about today's kids oh they're just like any other kids um kids are fine so yes moving to the apartment i'm living in <laughter> so like i said i know what advice i'd give myself ten or twenty years ago um uh uh stay away from my ex-husband <laughter> so a positive influence well my daughter i think i think my daughter has she uh because she's going to graduate from college in may and so she's managed to stay in school and she has a child but she's trying to do the right things do you wanna talk about anything else <sigh> oh okay oh okay goodbye <laughter>,1
312,yes fine how about you here yes the weather weather mainly yeah the main <ma> the weather sorry not the people well some of the people stuff like that some people okay i'm cutting you off not as much as i used to um i used to be in school i used to travel a lot of places for conferences and things like that but i'm not in school right now but later on i'll get back into school and i'll travel more but right no doubt i don't i don't enjoy traveling uh that's a good question you're actually pretty good um i studied physics and aerospace engineering but physics mainly yes i am actually right now i teach community college physics and astronomy uh but i still do research in physics also because i like that type of thing and i'm going back to grad school hopefully that's why i'm nervous sometimes on the questionnaire impressive professor at a place like u_s_c or u_c or l_a or like that where the professors do three hours of work a week and the grad students do the rest you're actually pretty good at this <sigh> i there's a lot of people the the first one i guess is my physics teacher in a_p physics teacher in high school even though he led me to be an engineer instead of a physics major um he still was a very good influence he told me you know he's the first one who taught me that school was not about a grade but about learning okay i'm pretty good i think i'm single so i don't get in many arguments um but it's probably my brother about he always like to uh play a video game together i know i'm pretty old to play video games but they're actually pretty good um it's probably something like that and me getting angry at him and him trying to defend himself and me being right that's all fairly close um i see them pretty  pretty often parents i see a couple times a week they're getting older so i've been helping with groceries things like that and my brother i see  same same with him same amount <amo> same time my sister i tutor her kids my nephews uh so i see 'em about once a week also interesting yes because i spend long periods of time doing math and reading and not talking to anybody that's introverted i guess i play video games or and i work out i work out i think a lot i try to at least i roll my eyes which i've been told is a bad thing um and that's about it i think <deep breath> bad parenting basically parents are more self-centered more to themselves unlike previous generations and the kids just  do what they want because the parents aren't there for <fo> the parents aren't being parents in my personal <per> own personal opinion <sigh> um i guess scrubbed_entry um scrubbed_entry scrubbed_entry thank you i don't really have a best friend introverted remember i'm biased obviously but they are i'm really good in math i'm not really sure if you can't not saying you can't get better than me in math but thing is it's just that you get reach a certain confidence with it where no matter what it is you need to learn in math you can always figure it out um i am patient i think and i am disciplined where i can spend i can spend many hours many many many hours reading books that might not be important but they might be important so i have to do it anyway that type of thing when i a good workout  doing well in video games small little things like that um what's really happy is when my my research type thing mathematical or physics type thing when it goes well that must puts me in a mood <mo> that puts me in a good mood thank you right now it's the fact that research that i did i did make it this far research wise that's all that's all interesting um when you start off in school you read about einstein and things like that it's he's this general xxx hero particle physics and you have no idea what it is and you know it's very complicated things like quantum mechanics and you still haven't realized you're interested in that and but you're not sure if you can actually make it and eventually each step as a lot of time goes by you wish you as time goes on you can get closer and closer eventually make the goal eventually you realize you are just not as good as einstein but you are up there you can do research in physics you can add to mass knowledge in science and that's impressive that you you don't see yourself doing that when you're a kid okay um a few weeks ago when i got a good grade in a class thank you yes briefly  many years ago <ag> yes i don't know it just always growing up i always thought that was i always thought it was my dream when i was a kid that's why and i just went about doing that  um i was a national guard i think about eighteen nineteen i got commissioned at twenty twenty one and i was only in for about a year so i left at twenty twenty two yes not really i don't think it did i think it's just something that you grew up something about <abo> something i grew up already expecting to be so it didn't change me as much graduate school in physics no nope it depends if i workout really hard the night before <bef> the day the day before if workout pretty hard it's bad but if i don't workout it i don't know just eh it's hard i guess moderately  thank you yes it's okay i'm probably like i am now normal i think not as not as happy about everything  but still pretty okay i can still function no maybe slightly sorry no yes yes i have changes in my thoughts um applying to grad school again it's been awhile and slightly apprehensive happy that it's looks good but apprehensive that it might not be good and things like that what do you mean by that in case i know this is a computer but as in how hard is it to deal with these thoughts or how hard is it to go into grad school i understand okay i agree no not really probably keep doing what you're doing even though i'm not that old believe it or not um twenty years ago i was probably fifteen no no yeah yeah it was fifteen um just keep doing what you're doing i think i i was very lucky and fortunate way it worked out if i worked if it was a little bit different i don't think it'd worked out so well even though it's not perfect now i think i'm doing really well personally thank you same here goodbye,0
313,sure uh okay i guess not bad not good so so denver colorado uh to pursue job opportunities uh about two years ago uh once or twice a year uh i really like the sunshine um all the opportunities all the different kinds of people lots of stuff to do that sort of thing uh i hate the traffic i wish the seasons were more distinct and that everything costs a lot of money here pretty easy hmm i'd say uh people are rude um not having enough money uh what else mm just a lot of things are frustrating i guess <cough> i guess it depends on  what i'm annoyed about like if it's at another person or about something i did or just life in general uh if somebody like a person annoys me i'll probably let them know they're annoying me until they stop is that what you're talking about okay uh so so not not as good as i'd like to be uh a few days ago about getting paid for something i did on time uh pretty pissed off taken advantage of i like to go to the gym uh hang out with friends read write that sort of thing mm at times uh because sometimes i like to keep to myself and don't feel like showing a lot of outward emotion i have a degree in in liberal arts majored in political science no i work uh in sales hmm to own uh several of my own businesses and and have lots of money coming in from different streams i guess if that's a job uh i used to live in mexico city that was pretty memorable um let's see it was pretty different than anything i've ever experienced it was a lot of fun exposed to a lot of new things and new people  uh i was pretty young carefree good times um not recently but i have in my life traveled quite a bit um let's see i went to london that was a lot of fun pretty cool city little too expensive but definitely cool of what just anything in life um let's see uh boy that's a good question um moving to l_a was pretty memorable took me a lot of hard work to uh move here so that was memorable i would say <sniffle> <clears throat> hmm uh maybe like six months ago uh things were just going really well didn't have much stress in my life uh yeah i'm i'm easier more easily irritated and uh yell more tired more uh kind of down feeling down more not as productive uh yeah awhile ago uh hmm mm don't know exactly it's been a few years but i still feel the same as i did when they diagnosed me so i assume i'm still depressed um well i just i'm a big believer in talking to people about your problems so i just thought that would uh be a good idea so i did it and and that's what i found out oh yeah definitely um i mean it depends on what you mean by therapy like i or most people probably can't afford good therapy but just even talking to friends i would consider therapy somebody who will listen so helps you get stuff off your chest  <clears throat> thanks um well i haven't necessarily seen a therapist per se but uh when you talk to somebody who listens and you and you get stuff like out there like out of your head or whatever it it's uh it helps to destress i think hmm pretty girls <laughter>  <laughter> um i'm a good leader i'm really smart uh being able to um survive on my own in a city like this completely on my own with no outside help  yeah lots of stuff um just dumb mistakes i made when i was younger that looking back now with what i know now i probably would not have made um i would tell myself to seek out and listen to people older than me as much as possible hmm scrubbed_entry he's always good for a sort of pep talk but uh with a dose of reality he doesn't sugarcoat anything so talking to him always helps give me perspective um talented and i don't know good at stuff i'm good at a lot of stuff people seem to notice that i i guess nice good disposition funny see you later,0
314,yes quite well feel good los angeles california here mhm one of the few um native born los angelinos i uh home school my ten year old son and uh i'm a home maker i have five children and married twenty two years mhm so that's a full time job huh uh somewhat we can we went to israel about two months ago um for a pilgrimmage with our church yeah so i would say yes i've traveled a bit uh well most recently we like two months ago went to israel for a pilgrimmage we were gone about nine days and it was fabulous it was we spent the first five days in chorazine which is near the uh galilee and in a place called uh uh i mean the the name of the area is chorazine but uh we stayed in a place called adonis galilea which is a um a house for that welcomes um christian uh pilgrims as well as jewish pilgrims um i i enjoy like really the most important thing i enjoy is like meeting the people and and of course seeing the the history i mean especially israel i mean it's the  it's totally ancient but um most most i enjoy is is the the people i think to uh get a better understanding of how different cultures um live no not at all just don't i you know all my life i've always been open and and uh willing to socialize and i remember my younger brother always um joking and saying that i i would talk to anybody and i will i'll talk to just about anybody just because i enjoy learning about other people um most of the time like by the end of the day after i've cooked dinner and we've had dinner together as a family um i there's a word game on the computer that i like to play for a little while and then um watch t_v have a cocktail with my husband and just relax that's what we do and you know 'cause we have a lot going on we don't stay up too late so i like to watch crime dramas um really mad probably not a lot um i get frustrated with for example my daughter does not clean up her room almost ever so that that gets me angry but um in terms of like really um getting like heatedly angry i mean other than like little things that my children do to you know especially my oldest child who's twenty one you know he can be confrontational so other than that nothing gets me like really angry haven't i haven't haven't felt that um contributing to society helping uh helping to raise um responsible people i guess um and of course the love and the affection and the um the fun and the excitement that goes with it of all the stages that go i mean like really right now i'm in a stage where my children are either adults or teenagers i only have i have one eleven year old and the rest are all teenagers and adults so it's really fun because we're able to um talk about current events and all kinds of stuff that's going on in the world and you know have have uh challenging discussions and that sort of thing so it's it's a different level than when you're taking care of babies and you know changing diapers and that kind of stuff the hardest thing is that it's twenty four seven um you're never not a parent you know it's and so you have to accept that and that's i remember when i first with my first child um thinking you know when i brought him home from the hospital this is it i mean there's no going back you you cannot um change i mean i guess you could if you did something horrible but i mean under normal circumstances you can't change um that and it's a permanent thing and um it it it uh in some ways it takes away your freedom but in other ways it give you a different sort of freedom mhm always i'm sorry i didn't get what you said um some of the things that've been a positive influence in my life most importantly my church um and my faith uh but also my husband he's been a really um he's kind of he's very like logical thinking and very you know grounded so when if i get emotional or i get upset about something he's always we balance each other out likewise if he's upset about something i'm able to balance him out it's been a that's been a a great gift in my life um i don't i i don't think i'd be categorized as somebody with a a temper um occasionally i i occasionally i get angry but i don't like have like rarely do i have outbursts um i'm more more likely to you know to say what i feel not let it build up so with you know like my husband and i don't rarely fight like have arguments that are yelling and screaming or anything like that it almost never happens because i i like i said i'm more of a type of person that communicates on the spot so if i'm thinking something i usually communicate it right away instead of letting it build up um usually i'm arguing with my older son because he um you know he thinks he knows everything he's twenty one years old so he has the know it all mentality  and i'm just telling him that he doesn't know it all and you know as life goes on he'll learn more he's very confident and very self uh self uh what's the word self assured and so he thinks that you know everything he does is correct and he still has a lot of learning to do that's all mhm it is it can be mhm i think um that many of them are um spoiled and live in an environment of uh of instant gratification um which i think is gonna be um detrimental to the to the future of this country but um you know given that with all the technology we have there's really not any way to go back so i i have um hope that um they will i mean i think this country was built on on uh hard work and and ethics and uh hopefully our our the next generation and the the generations after that can maintain that um that standard of living i don't know if it's possible mm as loving nurturing um funny we laugh a lot and um caring honest things that uh i mean my best i have  well actually my best friend is it's two people it's two sisters that i grew up with and um we i for some years took care of their mother who has alzheimers before my parents got sick so i had a very close have a very close relationship with them still do and so um i'm considered the fourth sister so i would say that those are my best friends and and um we love each other very much it's a good relationship no no yes most mostly mm minorly depression it was more anxiety um probably um um it's probably been five or six years i mean i've had if off and on all my life but it was never diagnosed originally like as a teenager i think is when i first had started with the anxiety but um other than that i i you know so depression kind of goes with anxiety if it's not under control um but now it's under control so i have a great huh um no i think it was what they call free [flee] float free floating anxiety more of a of of uh organic um reason for it in other words there there was a chemical imbalance  in my brain i've been feeling pretty good actually the holidays were great um we had a  good family gatherings a little stressed because um we're making a big decision right now to help my parents out um my dad is really sick um and we've offered to move in with them they have a big home but we would have to do a lot of some renovation and some to help and some obviously moving around and so we're in the throws of that and um so that's a big big change but i'm looking forward to it because really don't want my parents to be alone as they get they're in their eighties so as they get closer to death i want to have my family there with them um not easy usually all of my life i think i've always i mean i'm not i've always had um at least i wake up at least once in the middle of the night um to go to the bathroom basically and uh other than that i mean no now i sleep well i mean other than that i sleep well but sometimes if i wake up like really early in the morning then i can't go back to sleep  i'll get up and maybe do some work on the computer and then go back to bed and go back to sleep idepends on what my schedule is and if the kids are have to be at the school early and there's a lot of factors yeah sometimes it does mm probably basically the same i think i might complain a bit like oh i'm tired or my body hurts or whatever you know but um i think overall probably the same my kids know i'll be i'll tell me kids oh i'm really tired and they'll understand my older daughter will be really helpful they my other daughter will try to cook dinner or something like that so you know they may pitch in a little bit more uh not really not not no not really not anything significant huh um actually yes i do i do feel like therapy is useful um well uh we had a situation with my daughter um she also suffers from anxiety and um we have had her in therapy for some time and we just recently we're about to finish a group with her that was a six month um uh group for d_b_t it's called and it's like a  it's the first time they it's the first time they're documenting using it with teenagers and um it's been really good it's been very helpful it's just all about how to live in the moment and how to you know actual physical and mental um strategies to keep your uh keep you from your mind from going crazy you know worrying about things or you know in this case some of the kids have tried to harm themselves or whatever so um that's the focus of the therapy and it's been really good my husband and i both have been going with our daughter and it's been really um really informational and really helpful i think oh my daughter was um she was in a bad way she was you know suffering a lot and we knew it and um we acted on it that's all um like really joyful and happy i would say probably when probably it would be in israel when we renewed our marriage vows in the the at the in knaan  uh so um you know where the wedding of kana took place that was really moving and beautiful um and it was it happened that our anniversary was we left on our anniversary day flew to israel so it was right at the same time it was beautiful very meaningful and other than that i would say you know like uh other joyful occasions have been you know like christmas and you know family gatherings and you know my dad's birthday turned eighty three on christmas eve you know that kinda thing so um um that's an interesting question i would say um once i get like things done that i need to do like if i'm have a lot of chores [ch] a lot of either work to do around the house or errands to run once i get them done i feel like a sense of accomplishment you know much like i mean i worked for many years in a as an administrative manager at u_c_l_a and um you know once you get a project done or you get your whatever month end stuff done or if there's a lot of different things you have to meet deadlines there's uh that feeling of like yeah i got it done you know so i think that would be you know for me the most um most recent um way of feeling good and feeling you know like feeling accomplished dream job hm i think i've already lived it i'm also a birth doula and um yeah and um so i've attended a lot of births and now i really only do it for family and friends and um it's the most rewarding thing you could possibly ask to be involved in the birth the bringing of new life into this world so i would say that's probably was my was a dream job and i didn't know it i trained much after you know i did my managerial stuff and um was awesome it is and was awesome so i don't work at at a hospital anymore actually the hospital that i worked at is now closed but um i like i said i do it for family members um i attended a friend of mine's birth by accident she uh she had had the same o_b as i did with all my children and um i came to bring food for her husband when she was in labor we were you know close friends and her labor picked up quite a bit when i got there you know she wanted me to stay she didn't want me to leave i hadn't planned on it so that was the first birth that i had attended outside of you know myself giving birth which is a whole different experience so after that i was really interesting interested in possibly study un nurse midwifery but then i discovered this thing called being a doula which is really gives you even a lot more hands on uh one on one contact with the patient which is what i like so i trained to do that at at a hospital in inglewood um about fifteen years ago 'cause my son is fifteen and he was a year old no sixteen he was a year old so um yeah and i've been um well it can be challenging in terms of hours it depends on how long the woman's in labor but uh and you know also like for me i always tell my friends and family if they want me to be their doula that i cannot guarantee a hundred percent i'm not doing it for business and that way and because of that i don't have like back up doulas that in case i'm sick or unavailable somebody else can fill in for me so um but so far it's been that all the women that've asked me i've been able to be there for some reason so the um the uh the only one that i missed was one a friend of mine from church she wanted me to go with her second baby i was with her for her first but the labor went so fast she didn't even call me [laughter]  it was in the middle of the night she was like  two hours of labor she wouldn't even if she had called me i wouldn't have been there in time [laughter] so um it went really fast but other than that you know um yeah i've been been been able to attend all the births of people that have asked me to do um in all of life or in your job uh probably my my own birth i mean my the birth of my own children um like there's an extreme sense of joy excitement relief because of course you're out of the pain and then like it's just it's just a matter of you know going forward from there but it's it's like something you can't explain it's it's just it's awesome after you give birth and i have experienced both ways i've done both um natural and my last child was via c_section so i've had both both um experiences um i with my third child i had kind of a crazy nurse she was a little psychotic but other than that we laugh about it now but when i was in labor it wasn't funny and um she she was not there when the doctor i mean it was my my third child was born very quickly after he broke the water and oof my husband was there but she was not nor was the doctor and she got in a lot of trouble because i only had like two contractions after that my daughter was born in the bed so for me it was great 'cause i didn't have to go through any of the labor but um i'm sure they weren't happy to fill out a lot of paper work after that so now would i give mysef for ten or twenty years ago um ten or twenty years ago i was probably more not as um relaxed not as um like i feel now at my age that um i i don't have the same concerns that i did then i don't worry about uh i don't worry at all about what people think about me i don't worry at all about what you know you know like my i noticed my daughter's oh mom you can't wear that because people are gonna say this i just say i don't care you know but they do because it's still in their frame of mind that that oh mom you have to dress like this and dress like that whatever so that would probably be it the wisdom that you you achieve with age that you you see how life there are so many things that are more important in life than worrying about little things what are you most proud of in your life most proud of um probably my family my my husband and my my children i mean the fact that we've stayed married that we've we're an in tact family that um my kids see every day how their friends suffer who come from divorced families or single parents and they um they actually express gratitude sometimes that we are married and we still you know we are still a family so i would say that's probably it um probably the one of my best qualities is uh being able to listen to people and being able to um not be judgmental um through the years i've had a  a lot of experience with um people with problems a lot of friends with problems people i know from church and it's just taught me that um everybody has weaknesses everybody has problems and um i don't think i'm better than someone else if you think you're better than someone else then that's usually um to me a sign that you don't know yourself well enough okay okay goodbye,0
315,alright yes okay and you inglewood california yes no uh it's okay um you mean my girlfriend and my daughter yes they're they're okay it's okay it's cool yes i do um well i'm a football recruiter so i travel uh all around the world to to sign different football players for our sports management company  uh um just the independence about it being alone being able to be free and not tied down to one to one thing you know it's great i i remember traveling to uh scrubbed_entry and take him to clubs and this and that and we're not that type of organization <laughter> yeah um dishonesty i <sigh> i don't like when people are are dishonest um that really really really bothers me and not true not honest not real um that that upsets me a lot um i tend to just try to free myself from the situation to clear my mind usually take a walk or something like that or just just just go in a room by myself and just try to clear my head <he> my head   um i'm okay with it at times um uh but i can defintely be better oh um i argued <argu> argued with my my lady a couple days ago and it was about um our daughter and some of the things she's doing in school and she she wants to raise her one way and i think i wanna raise her kind of a different way and discipline her a little more on certain situations so i think discipline <disci> discipline is a big key and the key is life and she she she was raised a little differently um i don't know just angry upset you know when you're in a argument that's what you feel so you do and say things that  that that bother you and you just you go on with it  um yeah uh a little bit <sigh> um i don't know it just <sigh> i eh just the way i feel i don't know i can't really say just the way i feel um a little a little um i don't know just um realness um honesty the truth just being straight out front um i'm pretty close um i'm pretty close with my family oh whole nother subject just they're raised different um i i think society <so> society's gonna become even wilder with <wi> the way the kids are raised and no discipline and and the things they're doing everything we we they live and everything's inflated so much to where um it it's getting to a point where it's getting out of hand i think kids these days to a certain extent are are are much wilder than i was and and generations before me and just able to do and say and the lack of respect and you know just education-wise it's just i think it's just tough times for kids and and the way they act uh it's it's it's ridiculous to me um i definitely like to watch sports uh i i like to gamble i i like to travel i like to skate um i like kind of like uh a a a guy that likes to see different sights and go different places uh like different <difft> i'm a big movie person so i like going to theatres stuff like that um i'm actually living it um i i always wanted to be in in some kinda sports industry and that's what i'm doing now i just uh my goal was to get a little higher in the ladder and and own my own sports management company um but i'm doing pretty well for myself so i am happy yeah no no no um it's okay i'd say it's pretty easy irritated tired <sigh> i don't know it's been awhile it's been awhile couple weeks ago huh what did you say no not really um i think he would describe me as a stand up guy i try to be um um a good loyal friend and and an adult i think he would describe me like that  uh school went to school grew up together i've been knowing all my friends for pretty much all my life  yeah uh very close me our our uh my friends and i are very close uh um we pretty much do a lot together still at this age  uh i'm honest um i'm loyal very loyal um i am a hard worker i think i am um to a certain extent i'm just not the average guy i'm pretty much i'm a different different breed i just carry myself and act a little different from a normal guy  i don't know just how what i was raised and how uh my dad was kinda different uh and and and he didn't go with the in crowd and i think i learned that from him a lot and and it's just it it's it's um kind of the same path i took um yes a lot of things i regret um i regret a lot of decisions in my life um yeah one um i actually let a a lady in my life go years ago that i thought was my soulmate and  we had a big argument and one thing led to another and we decided to take a break and then that that break i i started dating somebody else and i told her i'ma go my way and she go her way i think that was a big a bad decision a very bad decision yeah totally i think i could've took a step back and really just thought about the situation a little more instead of uh <sigh> being so upset and moving forward uh just upset um i tend to get upset and then my thoughts get clouded so uh mm i i need to think a little more when i'm upset uh i don't know just experience and time being you know making making up for your mistakes and and and and um being better about different decisions after you made the mistakes um <sigh> think a little harder about situations <situatio> uh about situations and and things and the decisions <dec> decisions that you make uh think a lot longer and harder before you make 'em and i think the outcome would been a little different today um my grandmother she's always been a um a a positive influence uh she's a great black woman um with a old school um ways of living so um i think i i i've added that to my life she's a great woman scrubbed_entry in baseball and um yeah <laughter> um i was a pretty good player i was a pretty good athlete growing up um i was one of the top scrubbed_entry and uh that started a future in in athletics and that's what i wanted to do so i accomplished my goals so at the time it was a great a great thing and it still is a great thing it's a great accomplishment in my life   um <sigh> accomplishments being able to if i or if i'm  have a goal or or something i'm supposed to do that week or that day and i accomplishment it always puts me in a good mood or getting my job done and i the way i'm supposed to do it in a in a timely fashion that always puts me in a good mood um being a positive role model right now um for younger kids that's in um our sports academy program i i think as i got older the thought process and um the way i look at life has totally changed and i think i a lot of kids can look up to me that i deal with now and say you know that's somebody that that is is a positive <po> a positive influence in my life oh um couple days ago my football team um we're in the playoffs made the playoffs so that

different people uh different scenes um you know then uh try <tr> try try <tr> try to achieve my goals uh i'm sorry oh the they i used to run a business i used to travel to um meet people to get orders and that traveling involved uh going to northeast of you know ohio and pennsylvania uh places like that uh meet top uh people uh eh to get my uh to get orders for my business and uh you know i enjoyed uh listening to their problems i used to take them out for dinner and uh if you know uh i'll be i really enjoyed uh genuinely enjoyed uh talking to talking to them and um many of them were open enough to tell me about their problems and uh you know uh all my but my main goal main main objective was to get the orders for the business ooh mm you know cook um watch movies uh meet friends uh throw a party i'm talking to you uh i'd i'm an engineer i did mechanical engineering i'm also an m_b_a uh <clears throat> actually i branched off to finance i trade stocks now um <clears throat> a friend of mine was um you know making a lot of money in stocks and um you know i was um first i used to uh uh you know interact with him uh well also be with him when he was trading stocks and i realized he was uh making a lot of money then i uh did a formal course in it uh attended lot of seminars then you know um lost <lo> lost <lo> lost a lot of money and uh before i started making money uh it's the same thing that i said um you know watch movies go be visit people um play basketball uh then do shopping cooking i'm very good at that you know uh even <e> even when i'm irritated uh you know i'm very good at controlling uh my temper the last time i argued with was with my brother it was about my dad um you know uh he was getting old uh i mean he's getting old and um he lives in india and uh i was planning on uh bringing him here my dad's um i mean my brother said it's gonna be very expensive to um you know it's gonna be very expensive uh with respect to health bills and uh i was uh you know arguing with him that we should all pool in the money and get them here because they are quite old i have a mom too you know pool some they're both old i'm very close to my parents not so close to <t> uh um with my brother and their family um it's the i mean like i tend to be judgmental and uh you know but i think sometimes that the my niece and nephew should have been brought brought up in a different way and uh you know uh and you know my <m> my brother doesn't seem to uh think along the same lines and um you know uh we have disagreements and mm you know that's the reason it is um no not at this time what do i think of what um can you can you repeat that one more time um and i still couldn't follow you okay no no uh yes about <bout> one to two years ago i was feeling down <d> uh down and i was not interested in things that i was <wa> that i was normally interested in  and uh you know i was sort of withdrawn and um the it was sh i was not able to focus on my things so i thought maybe i should go see a doctor and i ended up doing that uh no mm xxx i lost appetite i was not sleeping well and i i had difficulty um concentrating you know and focusing and uh i was not getting uh my assignments done on time uh these <the> these were some of the problems i been feeling good but uh no i don't i started doing yoga and uh you know i've been doing that for about a year and that's uh and meditation and that's helped a lot uh it's just that uh you know when i was diagnosed with uh depression i thought i shouldn't be taking any medication for it and i was looking at uh uh other ways to get over the problem and uh then i realized some of my friends were doing meditation and uh you know i got influenced by them uh it's a little difficult but uh of late i've been able to sleep uh within half an hour  there are days when it takes almost one two hours to uh go to sleep are they what can you repeat that uh no i just uh you know uh just switch off the light and uh you know keep tossing around and uh try to focus on things uh that makes me uh feel good and this and that um about <bout> three days ago what am i proud of uh i was in i i was among the top two percent in my m_b_a class and um and when i used to run my business i designed a product um that was uh working really well and uh i was happy that i was able to design something that was so useful for my business uh my my i'm thinking my friends would describe me as uh very friendly very easy to get along with  uh very focused uh very intelligent  and a good cook um albert einstein uh i mean some <so> some of some of some of his theories um you know it obviously it involves <inv> it involves a lot of deep thinking and uh the the first few times i read about him about his uh uh theories uh i had difficulty in um um really understanding that and uh that you know we it i mean when's when there when there are things that i really try to understand and i i'm not able to i and uh you know there are there are the type of people i admire listen to other people uh it's diverse um and i like the the entertainment industry  and uh i like uh yeah the fact that there are more women uh than men here <laughter> um uh there are certain areas where only spanish <spa> uh where only spanish is spoken uh you know i would like uh for all people who come to america to be able to understand english and be able to speak in english  so that everybody can participate um in l_a um i mean like i some of the things the political leaders uh do really makes me mad uh uh sometimes i think they're wasting their wasting their time our time and other countries are advancing  and um you know these <th> these guys don't get things done and you know i feel very bad about it and sometimes it makes me angry uh yeah i mean the first four years of uh obama administration i'd i think it was wasted because uh if the if congress had acted together uh eh got things done then uh you know we would <wou> mm maybe we could have uh you know uh made it much more difficult for china to catch up with us and you know the fact that china's able to do things and get things done much faster and these people still um you know uh argue and uh you know find <fi> uh find faults with each other and not get things done um you know they don't seem to realize that you know uh you know the clock keeps ticking you know they have to get things done um i mean like you know uh <laughter> one thing that comes to my mind is well you know i made a lot of money while uh you know once in los angeles uh and you know i thought it happened during christmas some ten years ago and uh that that made me very happy good music good food uh i mean the eh a party with friends that i like and uh and you know i also like cooking and i enjoy cooking with groups in groups uh those are things that really put me in a good mood um i'm very clean um i listen to people and i empathize uh try to solve their problems uh and i'm hoping they think i'm you know uh my advices and recommendations are uh worth um their time thank you so much you've been nice bye,0
323,sure  good chicago  it's cold in chicago  hmm oh i think in ninety nineteen eighty nine actually  oh very simple very easy  oh weather of course and i'm so easily located to san diego palm springs las vegas san francisco and things i like to do smog of course is bad  crime rate's higher than it should be um  and financial economic problems here  every year thanksgiving  very very much so we're a very big family  yes i do very much in fact i love flying on airplanes i love visiting new places i even like visiting different airports everyone's different  ooh let's see  i started off in pre-med haha i ended up in uh physics yes i am i teach <tea> i teach physics  and math and higher level math  well i enjoy working with kids  i enjoy teaching my mother was a teacher uh my dad was a truant officer and uh i've enjoyed it keeps you young  my dream job  my dream job would be to be a judge  yes in in the uh  youth court that would be fantastic but i should've thought of that sooner than now so i'm not gonna be able to do that  no <laughter> not at all  um i enjoy people being around people i'm very talkative at times uh  i like to do a lot of things and i'm very social when i do them  uh believe it or not i play bridge i play chess and i watch a good old old movie  ooh bad drivers  uh bad laws  politics often  when i'm annoyed  you know i really don't get annoyed that much i just let it go  it's not worth the pain and problems they could cause if i can't straighten out a problem let it go   go somewhere else  ooh always my bridge partner but that's different uh as far as anything else i don't really argue with people i i don't argue i don't like confrontation my parents of course very very much so um i had great parents  uh  my mother uh my parents met at tuskegee which is a black college and they always want me to go to a black college but of course i didn't wanna do that <laughter> uh i went to illinois so they're a very positive role model for me there's certain things that i don't do today because of them i don't drink i don't curse i don't look down on people who do but i don't have as much respect for people who do a lot of either one of those things um  i love to drive i love to travel and my dad used to always take us some place every weekend he was off we'd go somewhere 'cause we were in chicago indiana michigan some place in the area we'd go up to michigan and pick fruit or we got all our dogs from uh puppy farms in indiana that kinda thing uh i had an uncle who lived in uh wisconsin who was a dairy farmer so my dad used to love to drive and i love to drive also  mm that's a hard one  i've had a lot of great experiences uh i think the best one was uh we went for my anniversary we went to europe we went to paris and uh  we rode the orient express we went from we didn't go all the way to istanbul we went from london to venice and then flew back to paris uh    that was probably the best experience i've ever had in my life i i've never really cared for europe because there's so much here in the united stated to do and so much in america and i had been to alaska and hawaii but we said we'd do something different and we'd always wanted to go on the orient express and we did that expensive but phenomenal trip gotta do it once it's a once trip not once in a lifetime just once not traveling more sooner we did a lot when the kids were younger  but um there are a lot of things we should've probably done we didn't do i wish i had gone to chicago <chica> we would always go to chicago on thanksgiving but i think we should've gone more than just on thanksgiving my parents come here at around christmas time but i think we should've uh done a lot more when it comes to that  yes that's that's that's why it's a regret because it could've been avoided there's things we could've done and we were spending our time working and more concerned about getting ahead than actually family and what's closest to us     i think that people <peop> most people oh yes very definitely  ooh  that's a good question ten or twenty years ago  i would've said um don't take things too seriously but don't be too relaxed over 'em either sometimes you can uh take things for granted never take anything for granted  nothing's promised  oh heaven forbid  <laughter> no i have not <laughter> no no  no  very very easy i really have no problem with that once in awhile if i uh am anxious about something or have things coming up due or projects due then i get kind of uh anxious a little bit  i don't like to be late uh i don't like to make mistakes so therefore i i do have some anxiety issues which will cause me to stay up all night to get things done just to make sure that i have everything right  tired  i don't get irritable i think i just uh lethargic maybe a little <litt> just a just a little bit  very good i was up late last night so i'm kinda tired now but i i usually have no problems sleeping  uh and i get a good night's sleep  mhm no i have not  um no not at all i just came back off a christmas break <laughter> so i'm should be very relaxed now ooh i have great kids  i have a son at u_s_c and i have a son at u_c_l_a  and my daughter just got married  so i'm i'm proud of my i'm really proud of my kids  they're they're going to have a good life  oh yes um i enjoyed it i still enjoy it  being a parent is forever <laughter> so  uh <sigh> let's see  taking care of someone else and getting started off to have a good life   i think that that's rewarding making sure everything is covered  that needs to be covered with you kids whether it's their eating their sleeping their clothes they dress make sure they're content make sure they have no problems at school or home or uh that that they're safe physically mentally spiritually everything hmm my best friend would say she has not changed since high school <laughter> uh level-headed but uh great sense of humor relaxed i don't take things too seriously ooh i love the holidays i love christmas i love everything about it i love preparing the house for it i love baking cooking especially baking i love experimenting with new recipes and so the last couple of weeks because the holiday season was just here i felt fantastic everything is is quiet i'm not at work i'm not stressed out in any way at all i have no projects due that i have to think about anyway  so uh christmas time holiday time  really enjoyed recently well christmas of course we went to las vegas um the twenty seventh of december that was fantastic <fantas> we only stayed for

originally thanks <laughter>  really mad uh  <laughter> really mad i you know i guess what makes me really mad is when my daughter acts stupid at school when she does not do her work and uh when she doesn't pay attention and i have to get phone calls home and letters home and emergency parent conferences that's what makes me mad  yeah  <laughter> yeah yeah it sucks she's one of the smartest kids in her school  no it's it's it's very difficult because a lot of things in yourself that you find are negative go to them and it's like you're fighting against yourself trying to change yourself but you know that little person is you you know times a hundred and it's just difficult to deal with that but um other than that it it's okay but it's being a parent is never easy   <sigh>  the hardest thing about being a parent  i would say is trying to give that little person so much life experience so that they don't make mistakes or so that they don't get hurt and you wanna give it to them and you want them to just accept it right away but then they don't so it gets very uh  um annoying sometimes that you know what's coming and you give them the info and they don't wanna take it they wanna find their own way and to watch them get hurt it's it's sad and then they wanna come to you and you're like ugh i tried to tell you but you can't be mad at them because everybody learns their own way so    mm yeah i guess for a while when when you think about it uh when you watch them go through their struggles it's hard to watch but it's a necessary motion of life children have to learn the way they wanna learn 'cause once they get it they got it so however they get it you as a parent you're happy they got it  <sigh> all the love the children bestow upon you it's great they  yeah they love <lo> you know love you and all especially my daughter she always wants to give me hugs she always wants to talk to me she always wants to be around me uh she always tells me i'm doing a great job when i'm like <laughter> what does she know about a great job she's only seven but you know they have that unconditional love and you just can't help but feel like a good person for having the children tell you that you're a good person so i like that  hmm oh <laughter> my god they're ooh <sigh> they're you know it like albert einstein said it best that our technology has exceeded our humanity and there's so much technology out there kids are learning so fast it's almost like they're already little adults but they're missing the steps to being a child they miss going outside they miss learning about things naturally rather than just going to youtube or you know wherever facebook and and getting it so fast and they don't know what to do with all this information and they just have to fight through all that info and they the it's not organic anymore children growing up these days it's not organic it's sped up it's pushed and it's just so hard for them to figure out who they are in this world so that's what's wrong hmm me <laughter> just <sharp inhale> breathe in <sharp exhale> and breathe out or i'll just walk away from the situation  argued  i argued with my fiancee uh a couple months ago about gosh i forgot i i forgot i don't remember  it was petty yeah but it didn't last long 'cause she's like me she doesn't like to argue about stuff we like to take care of stuff as it happens and that's it hmm my fiancee <laughter> well um well i mean we met um when i was working at at a charter <ch> not a charter school but at a recreational center we met there and uh we talked we hit it off uh we didn't see each other for an entire year and then uh we reconnected and we went on a date and it was great ever since my family we're pretty close my brother lives in colorado my sister lives in oklahoma i have a dad that lives in a neighboring city where i am um as close as we can be with the distance and certain choices that my family have made over the years you know being far away and um but my immediate family like you know my fiancee and my daughter like we're close and it's great <laughter> i don't travel enough but i have traveled a couple of times uh within the last five years i just came back from new zealand so that was a great experience  yeah  i enjoy meeting new people that's the biggest thing about traveling i like seeing new things i like just immersing myself in different cultures and situations and i like just being away from it all that's that's good too well i went to new zealand uh not too long ago and i had <ha> stayed there for a week um i learned about celsius 'cause you know here we have fahrenheit and that was fun uh i learned how to play cricket   uh i learned how to get myself out of a capsized kayak and um i learned that they have a lot of lamb lamb is good i like lamb but they had a lot of lamb oh and their seafood <seaf> seafood i can't eat but they do have really great chocolate chocolate is <sigh> it was so good and ice cream was good too and uh the people were really really nice they it was a very special time for me to go there it was great and they accepted me i love that and yeah can't wait to go back  <laughter> yes it was some of my best qualities um energetic uh very personable uh intelligent i am easy to get along with i work pretty hard and i'm very slow to getting upset about things  no  no no mm it's fairly easy  <laughter> uh i guess i get pretty moody you know i could be a little little snappy at people when i don't sleep well when i have lack of sleep but once i get some sleep in me i'm okay mm fine  no no no changes no scrubbed_entry um you know he would say that i'm pretty funny um lax about a lot of things uh i enjoy life as much as i possibly can um good friend to have around and always ready and eager to help <laughter> just waking up in the morning <laughter> it's always a great thing uh i love ice cream that's always good i love laughing ugh if somebody's laughing especially my fiancee 'cause she has a great laugh then that puts me in a good mood hmm thank you  scrubbed_entry and that's what i wanna do i definitely wanna get into acting and really work it and get some really good roles so he's been a positive influence he stayed out of trouble um he's maintained a good working relationship with people and he's always positive and very super helpful and very encouraging      oh we went to junior high school and high school together so he's my best friend  yeah  <laughter> yes it is  wow there's so many uh  scrubbed_entry had uh these bag of m and m's and we had went to a play and there were two girls that were a couple of rows down that you know we didn't particularly care for but you know that's how kids are you just they don't know how to you know they say they don't like somebody but you know anyway but we got these m and m's and while the it was dark we start throwing m and m's and hitting 'em in the head with the m and m's and then we came to school like three days later uh we were summoned and there was a mock trial to get scrubbed_entry so we were able to get ourselves off on like the entire group had found us not guilty of the crime and but then we got in trouble anyway because our teacher just wouldn't allow us to not get in trouble so we had to clean up the yard for like two days  oh man you name it uh i love scuba diving i've only done it twice but i love it wanna get back into it like traveling uh i love exercising i actually like working out now uh i used to think it was a chore but now i'm really really getting into it that i love watching movies you put me in front of a good movie and i'm a happy camper so that's about it hanging out with family  anything i regret hmm <deep breath> you know what i think i <laughter> i probably regret not going up to will smith when i had the chance  yeah uh will smith was coming up the street and i saw him and i got so nervous i jumped in the bushes and i didn't meet him uh my boss at the time thought it was really funny but i just i wasn't ready to meet him yet so but i think i regret meeting him   advice i would give myself ten or twenty years ago i would probably say that when my gut told me to do something i should've just went on ahead and did it rather than sit and analyze it you know days weeks months later if i feel it in my gut i should go for it so go with my gut more  really happy  hmm really happy i i had a film festival that i was putting together and things were so intense we things were going wrong but then things were going right but then once the people came and packed the house i was really happy that we had a packed house at this uh film festival so this was about a month ago  yeah  <sigh> let's see i think right now at this point i'm most proud of putting a short film together with a minimal budget but it has amazing actors it has a great storyline and i didn't think it could be done but it's done or close to being done and i'm i'm proud of that i was able to get it done i think i could walk away happy knowing that i gave it a really good shot and i think this movie is probably going to take me and the rest of my film crew buddies to higher heights oh really  alright well what was your name again  ah ellie  goodbye ,0
329,yes pretty well from new york uh to go to college well to san diego to go to college and then later to l_a aerospace engineering um it was i was really good at math and science and i had a interest in airplanes no i'm a life coach uh to be a life coach and help people um i really really like uh how it feels to help other people and see them grow and know that i made a contribution to their life  um i like the weather it's it's great 'cause i really like to do outdoor things and i like uh doing things by the ocean traffic <laughter> and how crowded it is yeah um i like i live with my girlfriend and so i like it  uh we met on e harmony uh really close um my meditation teacher um yeah i i used to be very shy and self conscious and had a lot of anxiety and um i'd worry a lot about the future and uh i took classes in meditation and yoga classes and uh it really helped me to be more confident and more relaxed and just enjoy life a lot more  uh meditate and do yoga um let's see really mad um  i guess i don't know about mad i don't get mad that often but frustrated uh i would say like being stuck in traffic or um people that do mean things to other people for no real reason  um i usually if it's i usually talk to somebody about it if i can or if i can't then i'll usually do meditation or yoga and try and just let it go  uh pretty good at controlling my temper uh with my girlfriend and it was about um she was driving on the freeway and uh i suggested that she get over 'cause there was some road workers on the side and she like refused to do that and stayed in the the right lane so we argued a bit about that  uh it felt like she wasn't listening to me and almost like she was purposely not doing what i suggested to be defiant   um no um rollerblade kayak uh sing i sing in a choir  um a trip i took to india and nepal for six weeks yeah as much as i can <laughter> uh i really i love to explore i've i've loved to explore ever since i was a little kid and so i love you know seeing new things and discovering things about new cultures and i love backpacking in the wilderness and you know exploring nature  cool um well i went on a a trip to india and nepal it's my first time ever there um first week and a half i was with a big group of people and did a meditation and yoga retreat and went white water rafting on the ganga river and then um i went off on my own for the rest of the trip and went backpacking in nepal uh with a guide there and uh it was just really beautiful um in the anapurna area and then i went to uh back into india and explored um the area up near tibet and then uh went to uh rajasthan and to uh tiger park in madhya pradesh and was like really close to tigers um there i uh was contacted by a friend of mine and told that they were going on this this trip and i'd always wanted to go to india so i decided to do it  yeah it was it was really fun um caring and uh enthusatic for life no no no um pretty easy uh i don't sleep as well as i did when i was younger but for the most part i i sleep well once in a while i'll wake up you know at like four in the morning or five in the morning when i want to sleep 'till seven and not be able to get back to sleep but um in general it's pretty good uh i feel tired and not as motivated as usual and then sometimes wanna take a nap you know in the afternoon um no  um ten or twenty years ago um i guess to i i wish i would have invested money or bought like a house or something when i was younger um that would probably be the advice i would give myself   um i am empathetic with other people um positive and kind of have a positive outlook on life um very determined when i decide to do something uh i'll figure out how to do it even if it's challenging um i'm very creative in figuring out creative ways to do things i guess probably the strongest thing is that i'm pretty balanced i'm very organized but i'm also pretty creative so um pretty balanced that way  um pretty close uh much closer than i was when i was younger um and although i'd say i'm probably closer to friends and people that are in a spiritual community with me than i'm able to get to my family  uh being outdoors in nature and exercising and also singing um the fact that i've gone with followed my heart and did what i wanted to do versus gong with what i think i should do um i guess yesterday i was i spent the day by the beach and just uh bicycled and went skating and um visited some old friends there um felt very relaxed and uh invigurated and um uh i also felt like i miss living by the beach because i used to live really close to the beach  so i guess i was a little bit sad that i didn't live there anymore but uh really happy to be there goodbye,0
330,<laughter> yes i'm okay with this very good l_a it's sunny and uh it's near the ocean <sigh> uh the traffic can make it difficult to drive around between different places and there's a lack of uh uh open uh spaces if you're not near a beach uh no um i uh i haven't planned on haven't finalized any travel plans listen to music yeah um uh well i tend to excel at things that  have to do with um uh spending time alone versus things that have to do with uh spending time outside with uh lots of people i'm reasonable mm maybe maybe yesterday i was trying to figure out how to stuff <stu> pack something into the car i'm very good at it <deep breath> i breathe in and out <sigh> like that <sigh> uh like jogging walking bicycling reading <sigh> listening to music uh math engineering computers uh a little bit yeah um i'm a student i'm going back to school for uh biological sciences um <sigh> started doing some reading on um some textbooks dream job um <sigh>  medical doctor uh it's i guess it depends on the type of medicine you practice <laughter> uh i have a mentor yeah i have a mentor who has a lot of positive um thoughts and um suggestions i uh through a professional so i met someone through a class and then they worked with them professionally so it's i guess you could say through an academic or professional channel <sigh> hmm mm <sigh> uh let's see one of my most memorable i can't think of one at the moment no no i don't think so no <sigh> takes me a little while to fall asleep but once i'm asleep it's it's reasonably okay uh i think i'm a little forgetful and nervous no sometimes mm what do you wanna know mm <sigh> well um i think sometimes i do think about  challenges ahead of me and uh that can be a little daunting and i i feel down it is very hard go for a walk read a book listen to some music um <sigh> i don't i mean i'm sure they are i'm not specifically sure what triggers anything uh maybe feeling overwhelmed or uh not feeling particularly tied to some task i don't go to a therapist um reasonably smart inquisitive <inqui> inquisitive and curious mm i guess through classes uh <sigh> somewhat mm patience and curiosity uh <sigh> enjoyed hmm mm think i went on a walk at night uh a day ago no can you repeat that can you rephrase that uh i think they're lucky very lucky got everything in front of 'em yeah uh <sigh> most proud of <deep breath> <sigh> maybe academic achievements uh i guess just the time i've spent studying math and science um hmm mm mm i'm not sure,1

344,yes i'm okay  i'm from uh los angeles california originally  yes sunshine uh the weather's great  it's about it smog pollution crime um  certain things like that yeah  i did in one point in my life i was in the military so don't do hardly a lot of traveling no more  seeing different sights different people i think it's more the people and being around different types a city and the people <peop> see meeting different new people  uh <sigh> i traveled to uh  new york one time and uh it was quite different big city  different people  uh that's about it  eighteen  uh yes i was <laughter>  uh no i did a lot of combat training but no combat  mm disciplined more uh more motivated uh you get a lot of things done more <laughter> even when you don't wanna do 'em you know you just go back to your army days and you get motivated off the stuff that that that you really needed to get done but you didn't wanna do it but it got done uh like uh  you had to uh do a lot of cleaning uh you had to wake up pretty early you had to do a lot of p_t you had to uh stay up to like two three o'clock in the morning you didn't wake back up until four or five yes <y> uh <laughter> to a certain point yes  after the military i joined the national guard and i did uh fifteen sixteen years in there uh i was uh excuse me ma'am i didn't hear that <th> quite hear that uh what made me decide to do that  uh just the motivation just you know really wanted a career see if i could find a career from it and it helped me out a little bit yeah    thank you  it wasn't that easy  uh i mean i'm sorry it was easy it didn't bother me too much to go back to civilian life  yeah it didn't bother me at all i just <ju> i adjusted pretty well  uh <sigh> history basically a lot um  yeah just basically history  uh no i'm not i'm uh disabled oh no it's okay it's okay we can all i can heal i can get better hopefully i will  yes i try to keep a  excuse me ma'am i guess i don't  my dream job would probably be working with others working with young people working with kids seeing that they get the uh the right and proper uh uh education that's you know that's due to them so they can be productive in the life of society as we live in today  yeah  excuse me  <sigh> what i think about 'em i think uh they should uh be more more uh <sigh> xxx i mean they should they should <sh> participate <tapicitate> more in what they're doing in their lives they should ask more questions they should be more motivated to uh really achieve something within their lives to give them the mm to give them the confidence and the motivation they need in life 'cause a lot of 'em don't get it <sigh> when i see people do really really stuff that they really shouldn't be doing  uh <sigh> it really eeks me i mean really bothers me and when people talk to you they give you the run-around it's like won't you just be straight with me instead of just giving me the the run-around <laughter> won't you just be straight up with me that can be very frustrating uh and really when people do really i'm trying to find the right word stupid stuff <laughter> that really botthers me too   uh spray painting on the wall  uh just throwing garbage anywhere and not picking it up uh not really being uh you know not really being  hygiene you know taking care of yourself and being hygiene you know what i mean  yeah  <sigh> what i do when i'm annoyed uh i get really upset i really start really cussing people out to be honest with you and it's something that's not really me but uh i'm learning to really let go of it a lot you know just you know just say hey that's the way it is it's like i'm not in control i can't control it yeah i have only have to control the things about what i do and really getting upset off of what other people do is not really good it's not good for me oh my temper can be controlled i can control it pretty well  uh  i i don't know i think it probably was my sister and she's very controlling and it's like you have your life and i have mine don't tell me what to do yeah  we real close i can get along with 'em we're real close i have no problems with them   yeah very good  uh  this morning <laughter>  yeah i wake up pretty you know i i first thing i do when i wake up in the morning i pray so when my spirit's in connection with the uh <sigh> the universe and the world i i feel pretty good   yes  uh <sigh> up and down you know up because i'm motivated to get out and start doing other things in life than just not doing anything at all and then other times where you wanna get something accomplished and you can't really get it done because there's road blocks in the way but uh i'm learning how to uh overcome those road blocks as well uh  well for instance uh looking to go to school and i was having problems uh getting enrolled in school i was talk to one of my social workers and she was willing to help me get online and uh to do it so i'm like okay it's well it's gonna get done <laughter> yeah  uh can you repeat that one more time ma'am  uh yes i have  see i had to be uh <sigh> i'd say uh for the last couple of weeks uh i noticed that i go through certain situations like you was talking about the anger situation it's like i don't get angry all the time that's not me so sometimes when i get angry i have to find out what's causing all this what's what's causing me to get angry  and i have to take  excuse me ma'am  uh it's not hard at all 'cause alls you have to do is just take your time and reflect about everything uh that you have gone through and uh take a good look at the situation and uh and then go from there and find out what's what's really bothering you  it's very seldom  uh i suffer from p_t_s_d and uh getting that type of sleep would be would be great  because i have recurring nightmares so of a incident so  <sigh> i i think it is and i don't know what it's triggered by but i think it is and that's why i'm talking to someone or seeing someone 'cause i'm a veteran  at the uh v_a about the situation now about the p_t_s_d basically right now  excuse me ma'am  uh <sigh> a lot of nightmares lot of problems lot of anger issues uh depression uh i noticed all this in me and uh i started i just started to just tell myself i needed help  and that's that's basically it i just you know i just you know i just something wasn't wrong with it something wasn't right with me  and when something's not right with me i have to take time out to just you know take a good look at myself and ask myself if something's right then you if something's right then that's fine if something's not right then you need to take care of it   and uh i just started seeking help down there yeah  somewhat yes it is somewhat  'cause i'm able to sit down and talk to the therapist  well i'm able to sit down and talk to the therapist and uh tell 'em my situation and we usually will go over the problem and uh i went to classes i've been to uh uh talking one-on-one with my own doctor so it's helping out a little bit  yeah  it's a good thing excuse me ma'am no no not really  my best friend  uh they he would describe me as a fun loving good person always there that try to help others uh  think more of others really than more of myself but when i know i need things need to be done for me i take care of it so you know and they really actually they really look up to me they have a lot more respect for me yeah they see something in me they wish that they had   excuse me ma'am uh can you be a little bit more specific  oh okay  uh books crossword puzzles uh walking that's about it  i thought i did but i don't think i do i don't think i regret anything because  this is this is how it is this is the way it is for me so i accept it and i keep moving on  because if i regret anything in the past then i'm wasting my time on that because it's gone that's the past i need to move on i need to live in the present so i can be prepared for the future so i can move on to the future  yeah  <sharp inhale> uh <sigh> more education uh  being more direct and more confidence in what i'm doing like i am today so yeah that's what i was lacking maybe twenty years ago  uh yes <ye> yes i have had a lot of positive people been been in my life  uh <sigh> yeah some people would uh uh uh well consistently <cons> xxx i mean consistently motivate me to continue and to pursue a certain goal and uh i thought that was pretty good because i really don't see that a lot and uh he gave me a lot of motivation to try to go up and try to do certain things 'cause anything that you do it's a choice it's up to you whether or not if you do it or not that choice is still up to you for it to be done   excuse me ma'am  uh <sigh> that i'm able to really be able to be self-motivated and really be able to put my best foot forward and be able to get a lot of things accomplished which i thought i couldn't but it can be accomplished if i'm willing enough to put the will to it to do it oh wow huh  oh really and you know what i really enjoyed was sitting down with my social worker and we're talking about getting things done within my life and school was one of 'em uh  and just being just school was one of 'em and i kinda liked it that because that was the first time someone was willing to really sit down with me and work with me  yeah and i thought that was a great thing so as long as you're willing to do that i'm willing to go even the extra mile and even be motivated to do other things besides school and uh yeah that and that and that's what gets me going oh it is and i love it and uh this is going to be accomplished  thank you  goodbye ,1

sister yesterday it was just something stupid over like my sister is sitting was sitting in the front seat and she's a kid and it's like i'm i should be in the front seat so i just asked her to sit in the back and of course they start like yelling and arguing and it's like really annoying <laughter>  yeah it does thanks  my grandma she's always giving me encouragement and um she's a therapist a licensed therapist so she's always you know made it really really um  easy for me to have someone to talk to and i could always go to her so that helps yeah  yeah  my most memorable experiences well i had one really good experience um i went horseback riding and that was really really made me happy uh i love horses and nature that's the biggest thing that i love and it just made me so happy and so relaxed so that was a memorable experience <laughter>    um caring very caring always there to talk to um i don't judge i never judge i'm never cranky i'm never i never ever get like angry at anybody else just like my family you know but yeah just very nice caring and stuff <laughter> um things that put me in a good mood like uh music nature um i like to cook a lot i like to cook you know for my family talking puts me in a really good mood i love meeting new people meeting new people puts me in the best mood uh it's not easy um it's hard um sometimes it's it's really hard um   i don't usually sleep well so um yeah i have trouble falling asleep mostly  um i guess it's just like my mind will be racing a lot of you know sometimes it'll be flashbacks of bad memories um just you know thinking too much <laughter> um i don't know um i think just uh  stress you know a lot of stress every day just everyday stress uh yeah pretty much that's what triggers it <laughter>  um i just try to stay positive i try to think like okay well you know one day things will get better um   i just i try to call somebody and talk to them if i have trouble like my grandma  yeah  thanks when i don't sleep well um well i start to like cry a lot and i start to get really irritable um i get really depressed it makes me not feel well at all i get very uh it just is really really bad if i don't get sleep yeah  yeah  thanks yes i was diagnosed um three years ago  uh i just i didn't really know what was going on then i realized okay well they just diagnosed that and um i was like okay well this is the problem and it i just wanted help because it just when your mind is after you like that's like it's just awful to have your mind taking control of you like that  yeah  yeah it's hard  um yeah yeah i definitely always thought i had a problem i always thought something was like really wrong um i just always like kinda nervous around people like i never can really like look anybody in the eye 'cause i'm just so nervous my eyes are always kind of like racing and i um would have sweats if i was in the situation um that reminded me of the situation like i just try to avoid what reminds me and brings those flashbacks yeah  oh um i i've been feeling good i've been getting out more every day i'm trying to um i guess walking keeps my mind off my p_t_s_d symptoms so i'm trying to walk more that helps  thanks um yeah i have depression um yeah  um it helps yeah it actually does help me a lot um i currently don't have one right now i'm actually getting a new one in a few days though like it's kind of a mix-up but yeah it really really helps me  um i noticed that i've had less flashbacks and um i've been more relaxed i guess and um yeah just you know trying to keep more occupied yeah it helps  um the last time i felt really happy um i guess um i don't know um today 'cause i mean i'm glad to be part of this <laughter>  um most proud of uh well <sigh> um i'm trying to think of what i'm most proud of um  i  think i'm most proud of like the fact that i am able to you know not be like well i mean most people i know they like deny that they have a problem and i'm proud that i can actually like you know be a person who can realize okay i have a problem and i need help but a lot of the people i know they don't take medication they're untreated and um they just don't wanna get any help and i'm glad to get help because i don't wanna feel that way and i wanna get help for the problem instead of doing that  oh gosh there's a lot i regret yeah there's a lot um i regret you know uh drug abuse you know but that's part of you know the p_t_s_d i regret um a lot uh mistakes you know relationships stuff like that  wow um i would've told myself to um i guess the advice i would've given myself was to  try to keep my mind more relaxed i guess yeah um well i'm a very nice person and i always like to smile people are always saying how i smile a lot but um the smile i guess it kind of hides like what's on the inside but you know i'm pretty depressed you know but i just try to keep smiling and i always like to lend a hand to help and make people feel better  for fun um i like to go to the mall that's a lot fun i like to go to the mall i like to go out with my grandma we go places go shopping i love shopping and um i like to go um play like games like i like to play video games those are fun stuff like that okay thanks goodbye,1
346,yes  i'm okay  here in los angeles  there's a lot of things to do i love the beach  um i love the i love that it's sunny all the time  um the amount of people  um  that's really about it the amount of people  just a little  i just like um going to new places and just discovering new things  um i recently went to new york i was there for about three months  um and it was extremely boring i went to western new york  um and it was extremely uh snowy and um  i didn't <didn> was in a position where i didn't have a car so i didn't get to go very many places and i was in a small town   so um  i uh  uh it was beautiful for what i got to see but really  it wasn't really much to it <laughter>  yeah  um  both i'm both an introvert and an extrovert  um  i really enjoy doing things by myself  um  i um have a lot of my own um my likes and dislikes and i've spent a lot of time alone even though um i have <ha> i do have a lot of friends and uh when i do go out i i do tend to meet a lot of people but um i also enjoy um being by myself a lot  um  probably outgoing creative um  talented  um fun trustworthy  um  i studied language um  and um physics  and um  math no i'm not  i'm actually um i'm um i'm trying to be an actress  it was something that i fell into when i was a teenager  scrubbed_entry and uh i really enjoyed doing it and i hadn't done it for years um  so i figured why not i just came back to california and might as well try something that i did enjoy really doing   um so far um i just got picked up by an agent  so i haven't really done anything yet as an adult  but um  i'm hoping  hoping something it'll be fruitful   um  <sigh> i really don't haven't had too many  um  i guess my sister she's done really well  um  my boyfriend he's a  he's a very positive human being  um  but um  really i haven't had too many positive influences  um  i'm close i mean we <w> we hang out um i i don't tell them everything  um they're kind of judgmental  but um  other than that i mean i mean we hang out i mean i see them every day  um  geez um  it's kinda hard for me to relax um i mean i try to watch t_v um and i read  a lot um  that's probably about it i read i do a lot of sleeping <laughter> i'm a little depressed so um  yeah it's kinda it's xxx like i said it's really hard for me to relax  um  it isn't  um i tend to think a lot  um about the things that stress me out  um i've been through a lot of a lot of stuff so um  yeah so i i don't i don't i don't sleep very well at night and if i do fall asleep i wake up all through the night usually with some kind of anxiety attacks  um  i dream a lot about um the stuff that has uh  has affected me throughout the years so um  it's usually you know like i i'll dream about something that stressed me out and then i'll wake up and my my chest'll hurt    um  or just i just can't sleep all night because i just think i seem to be i don't know if i'm afraid to go to sleep  but i uh <sigh> i just i don't know i feel like that <th> that's a vulnerable place for me  because of stuff that've happened to me  so um  i i so i sleeping is just not really something i do well  um  tired  i'm uh  i'm moody i'm very sensitive  um  i uh i'm just negative <ne> a negative person  um which really that's not me um  i uh yeah i'm like <l> judgmental is not me either um i just  i'm just not a not a nice person to be around  um  i try to <t> i i spend a lot of my time reading i try to go out and do um i force myself to go out and do things um  just to keep myself involved  um so that i don't uh sit <si> just sit around and and and dwell on the fact that i can't sleep and i i try to um get myself as exhausted as i possibly can  um by running around and and and doing things  so  um it's difficult  um i do like there is a part of me that doesn't wanna  i don't really wanna go out and do things i have to actually force myself to um if i have make appointments i uh  i make appointments to like for auditions or or um  even to do this i um i i tend to uh  just not  like at the last minute i'll i'll try to convince myself not to go <laughter> but then i force myself to anyways   yes  um i've been diagnosed for two instances  um i was diagnosed <dia> diagnosed about three years three and a half years ago  and then i was diagnosed again um in august um  the first time it was um  i just wasn't sleeping <sl> because of the not sleeping um   and the uh just the stress <st> the unbelievable stress  um  and then the second time it was a xxx uh once again i started with the not sleeping um and then every moment of the day was just thinking about what happened to me um  and i just i i just couldn't take it anymore  so i i figured um  i was getting too gloomy i was getting like um  not thinking life was worth it and and i i i that's i just needed to see somebody before anything escalated  yeah  it was  i no <n> do not um one of the reasons i went to new york was to try to um  get out of my environment  um and uh  and that seemed to help a lot  um  and uh out here i i was i just the counselors that i was going to just didn't really seem to be helping me much  um they just  they just seemed to be giving me a lot of medications and i don't believe that that's what i needed  um  yeah so um  yeah  <sigh> stressed um uh lately i've been really sad and i don't know why   um  but like i said i've been trying to combat that by um   keeping myself busy  um  actually um  i'm kind of a couple days ago  i was actually really happy and i was genuinely happy   um but then i went back to  being you know going back to feeling miserable  so um  well i realized  i got up in the morning i actually did get a good night of sleep  and um  i realized uh that i'm actually really lucky  um 'cause i've been through a lot in my life and i have um somebody in my life who really loves me and somebody who um is finally there for me  and uh  you know he gives me what i need emotionally and i was just really thankful for that  and that made me really happy  um  yeah  thank you <laughter> oh geez um  i've had so many years of just  just bad just a lot of bad  that it there has it's been a long time  since i've been proud of anything  i guess if anything it's my ability to survive through all the hardships i've been through  um my <m> a lesser person i guess would've  gotten rid of themselves a long time ago  but um even though like i'm really depressed and i feel gloomy and i feel <fe> just feel miserable about a lot of things um  there's gotta be a silver lining  so  um so yeah so i mean like i guess that's what i'm proud of that uh  i although a whole bunch of bad things have happened to me it hasn't ruined me i still try to be a good person um i i try not to be negative towards other people  and um  and truthful and i still i still have drive in me  yeah  ugh <sigh> so much um  my last marriage um not getting out when i should have  um  and uh just i regret a lot <sigh> um the any situation that would've had a red flag um  eh just get out of it you know eh some things just don't work and um  no matter how hard you try no matter how much you put into it so um  i i would tell myself um to um  that it's not selfish  to let go of a bad situation  and um not everybody can be helped so sometimes you just gotta live for yourself and help yourself  so if had i known that then had had i known that then i i i probably would've done better in life so  yeah  <sigh> um people who um  when people are down on me for my faults  um that i have done that i have things that i've done in my past that people steal still relive when i'm trying to forgive myself um  people who are mean to other people uh people who talk poorly about people behind their backs people that are untrustworthy um just anybody who picks on the little guy  um  you know people who don't care about the environment or animals um  i just <jus> i think that everybody should be as good as they possibly can be  and uh it's it's disheartening and it it just makes me so mad that people just can't be people don't let people live people try to make um everybody feel as negative and as poorly as they do  and uh i that makes me mad  <laughter> i vent <laughter> um  yeah i tend to vent and then uh  and them um and then it's usually over i try not to bad mouth people um i try to just talk through it until um until it's gone and then it doesn't bother me anymore mm i try not to get angry um  because i have a really bad temper and it um  and it can get outta hand so um  what i do is i i <laughter> something gets me so mad i tend to go and take a nap  um <laughter> if i'm not in that situation where i can just go and take a nap um i usually just walk away from the situation and i try to clear my mind and come back to it  um  it was a couple days ago it was actually with my mother um  it was about um  actually she thought that i had taken a shirt from her  and um she was screaming and yelling at me and um  i was i was tired um i was it was late and um  i started to yell at <a> back at her you know because i was hurt that she would accuse me of something so petty um  and you <yo> <sigh> it's uh going back to my past you know when i was younger and you know i didn't care about you know people's things and i would just kinda take and do whatever i wanted to and i'm not i'm so far from that person   um and i it it hurt me so i got mad and i and i started to yell and argue  mm kinda petty and stupid but  at the time it it seemed  it seemed uh  viable  um  hmm one of my most memorable experiences  um  god <go> i've had so many um  maybe it was um  i don't know um  it was  probably um  graduating pharmacy school  um i felt pretty great i didn't know if i was doing  uh very very well or not um and i ended up getting like on my last test scores i getting <get> ended up getting like ninety eight percent  and um  i uh  i actually i didn't <did> i had no confidence <laughter> that i had done well in class in school at all and i i didn't even know how i was getting the grades i was getting um so that was a really big accomplishment for me um  and uh yeah that was a great it was a great memory yeah  yeah  um  i'm reliable  um  i um  i'm talented  um i i'm a good listener um  i'm always there to help people  um  i tend to always try to do the right thing  um  sometimes actually i forget that i have any good qualities but  um  and just  i uh  all around i try to be you know as as good and the best person that i can be to other people and myself um  yeah  um  going to comedy shows  um  just um  having moments where you just laugh with people  um  sometimes just reading puts me in a good mood uh  i don't know probably that's about it  uh huh  okay  thank you  bye,1

349,yeah  so so <sigh> nebraska  uh work i've been coming here off and on for years but officially moved here couple years ago  um  some good days some bad days i i guess i've gotten as used to it as i'm gonna be i don't know if that makes sense but  um <sigh> accessibility to to different things um as compared to nebraska um you know more opportunities to do different things and and explore different things  areas of interest uh the crime um  attitude <laughter> um  uh lack of lack of uh  uh work ethic lack of uh  kindness in people um cut-throat  yeah  i used to quite a bit  uh sense of freedom  the uh the adventure  um okay  you want me to tell you about a trip <laughter> uh egypt  i  yeah  uh i went with my mother and some family friends we went on an eight day cruise down the nile saw all the uh pyramids in giza um just it was just a incredible adventure just to get away from everything and everybody and and uh close friends and just have a great time  yeah  um not really at all  um just uh uh have history of um abuse and and neglect and uh just not a real functional family dysfunctional is is definitely a keyword in our family so  thank you um no not really i'm talked about it a lot before um so  i'm okay with it  <sigh> um <sigh> <laughter> it's really hard to say i haven't had very good uh uh very positive role models um um  ask me the question again  <sigh> well maybe at best my mother  but uh she's a she's also been a negative uh aspect of my life but um  uh yeah i guess i can't really identify anybody who's been a real real positive influence in my life  um the the trips that i've been on  um i used to  work out i used to do yoga i used to um  i used to meditate i used to exercise and i used to um i used to do a lot of things lately um i find it uh hard to relax i don't have the same uh  the same outlets that i did before the same uh i <ss> i i don't pursue them as much anymore i guess i'm i've lost my motivation or something i'm depressed about it you know i guess there it is right there  um pretty good i i is temper as far as getting to the point of uh uh physicality i don't ever that um  uh but i stand my ground and um but i can control my temper i i i never lose control really   um <sigh> the last time  uh probably  um as recently as you know  in the last month or so i maybe argued with um  uh an acquaintance over um  uh <laughter> uh i don't know i i have to come back to that question  no no yes um  well officially october of last year but i've i think i've been depressed longer than that but officially october of last year  um  actually i was uh being treated for other medical issues and um my depression was notable to the doctors so yeah  yeah  um  well i've never been suicidal but just to just to just in i i just often have thought um  eh that i don't have much reason to to live i used to think i had a purpose and such but um i don't really have anybody in my life um  who i think cares enough about me uh  that i really <rea> if i was even dead uh so um i've kind of lost myself  and um i used to that used to be enough  that i was um enough to uh  you know to to have purpuse in my life but um  i've lost quite a bit of that  motivation <motiv> yeah  well i'm trying to pull it together i'm trying to um  <sigh> get back a sense of me  i get inspired every once in awhile but um overall i just don't seem to be making much progress  yeah  i wouldn't really call it therapy i don't have a therapist per se i have a a nurse practitioner who prescribes medication for me and nobody really to talk about psychosocial issues  um i uh huh  did you say that sucks eh  okay  and uh yeah  um overwhelmed preoccupied um  just uh trying to stay alive stay on top of things  no uh  easy when i can i don't um  yeah when i if i get a chance to fall asleep i don't have any problem with it  um even more distracted and uh um  um even more  uh lackluster i guess is the word  whatever uh if i had a best friend um <sigh> i don't know um <sigh> he maybe lot of positive adjectives before but now just you know just uh some people say i should be proud 'cause i'm surviving a hard time or some people think that uh  i'm a a loser  <laughter> so um i don't know <sigh> maybe um  a survivor uh persistent um um well i used to be proud of my career and um  kinda giving back to people giving back to society um 'cause i was given  a lot it felt like um <sigh> so i'm just proud to uh  i don't have much of a sense of pride anymore to be quite honest i i've um it uh i don't know <sigh> <laughter> psychology and um  well initially yeah  um no not really per se although my current career involves a lot of uh  psychology a lot of um  uh the aspects i don't know what i'm trying to say um  it's a part <p> it's a part of it but it's not the center of it  um well i guess if my career is still going i'm in uh nursing but um i've been sick lately and with depression and other healthcare problems i  uh have uh found it necessary to apply for disability social security income  and i'm starting the process of that 'cause i'm not working   very <sigh> educating people um making a difference i mean i used to i had i've had my dream jobs i've had my dream jobs i don't uh  i don't know what the future will hold for for uh work but um  something i suppose working with people again health uh helping in some way  um no but lately with the depression more so at times i used to say that i never regretted anything 'cause i would make the best decision of all things in front of me but um  i just wish there were times then that um  the choices that i would have were  <laughter> were better 'cause some choices that i seem to have made or were made for me have um made my world kind of shitty   for lack of a better word shitty  what i don't understand  <sigh>  to be strong to um believe in myself  to remember that i've survived a lot of things and i will survive this too   to get up off my ass and move to um <sigh> to have confidence faith  um <sigh> i just murphy's law has kicked my ass   so much you know i just uh  it it seems like when i've tried to make my world better i just keep getting knocked down um so it it's almost like i'm i don't wanna give up but um every time i try and move forward i get knocked back and it gets gets exhausting  and i don't have any support system really nobody not really  <sigh> um  loyal um hardworking  um  dependable  um  uh capable um well at least i used to be uh  intelligent  comtemplative um eh uh deep not a superficial person um  yeah i guess those are some of them  many years ago  um i used to have a lot of confidence i used to be pretty dynamic person i used to be people would <wou> say <s> used to say that i was the most centered person that they knew and i used to help people and i'm now in their shoes and i don't seem to be able to help myself  <sigh>  <sigh>  i can't think of anything right now <laughter> i can't think of really anything right now  i don't do much anything for fun anymore i used to however um go to movies and and entertainment venues and travel go to dinner with friends do things um but lately i don't i don't really have any pursuits   a good day a happy day a fun day for me is a day without something going wrong  basically  <laughter>  mhm yeah  bye,1

well one of my favorite trips was visiting africa in i think two thousand six i visited uh west africa and that was a great trip for me it was a medical mission where we volunteered and gave medical assistance to people  a friend of mine uh was actually involved and she talked to me about getting involved so i went in with her and it went from there so i don't know i made the decision that way   i am i am happy i did that it's something i'll never forget <laughter>  i studied english and education so that i could teach high school students  uh not currently no well right now i um tutor privately for a private tutoring company and looking to get back into the classroom working as a teacher  mhm wow anything that uh combines teaching traveling and writing would be a dream job for me so yeah anything that combines those three items so teaching has the closest outcome to that    um  occasionally yes <laughter> um <clears throat>  i don't know i guess in comparison to others that are considered outgoing um and and a lot of people have said i seem reserved or kinda introverted i don't know   mm well  i don't know i read um i just started meditation  mm try to breathe and calm down <laughter> yeah  some things that make me really mad um  mistreatment of children  abuse of children  um try to figure out what's annoying me usually and then go from there uh if i can control not being annoyed like ultimately i control that whether or not i'm annoyed so try to figure out what the problem is and then go from there and not be annoyed <laughter> if i can help it all  oh i'm fine i can totally <to> in at controlling my temper i think so i don't have a yeah    the last time i argued with someone  was um  i don't know maybe a couple of days ago and it was about um it was about um a smell they had on their clothes but i thought smelled like perfume and they said it did not so <laughter>  yeah  <laughter> this is cool uh i think i'm very close to my family we're a pretty close knit family talk every day um see each other almost every day  there've been a lot of positive um influences in my life i would say my aunt and uh definitely my mother have all been positive influences  well um i look i look <l> i uh <clears throat> look up to my aunt um i think she's positive i look up to her  because obviously we grew up with very similar backgrounds came from very similar neighborhoods and areas and she's very successful um despite the types of things that we've gone through as children  and um she doesn't let her past define her future uh my mom's overcome so many obstacles as well um she had some challenges with her health but she still tries to be optimistic and she's still tries to   you know overcome these things and just still live our life despite some physical barriers that she might have so i look up to people who are able to  you know not allow their current situation to dictate their future because anything is possible   no i have not  no i have  um well i was diagnosed um within the last um year and uh then again most recently within the last three months  well um fear and just not knowing what to do with uh some of the things i was feeling and not knowing um you know why i couldn't stop feeling the way i was feeling  there were a lot of symptoms um  um you know mostly i uh i gained a lot of weight um i couldn't sleep a lot and then sometimes i could sleep too much <laughter> um  felt sad sometimes  like i wanted to cry a lot  i've been feeling okay um there are days yeah um i don't know every day is different so i mean today i feel fine but like i said everything is differently lately i've been feeling um more like i can be involved <inv> involved in my own life and like i wanna get   out and do more things  um  no no it's no no i haven't  not any different from before what i was experiencing before  no  mm well mm i was receiving um  uh i guess psychotherapy and um i don't know a lot of things happened i moved for a while to go take care of my grandmother and i just kinda  got more involved in taking care of other people instead of myself for a while  uh sometimes  i do  yes it is it's kinda difficult um i either have a hard time falling asleep or a hard time staying asleep i'm sure it is i just don't know what it is as of yet because i you know <sniffle> usually it's um thoughts continual thoughts running through my mind that either keep me up or make it hard for me to uh go asleep or make it hard for me to stay asleep mhm um journal sometimes uh that might help if i can write some things down and get it out that helps other than that i don't you know i haven't found any really great ways of coping  it tired <laughter>  yeah mostly uh tired um kinda confused  i don't know for the most part i feel happy it's just um   last time i felt really happy was i guess over the holidays  uh i don't know i guess the just being around uh family and friends just the holiday season i guess in general that's just a happy time for me and seeing people i haven't seen in a while um that's about it  how would my best friend describe me probably as um  quiet sometimes cautious talkative sometimes um tenacious  um i don't know a lot of my friends say that they look up to me for uh some of my accomplishments and they also say that they are grateful to have me as a friend because i'm caring and compassionate or um easy to talk to um that i remind them of a of <o> feel like a sister to them  <laughter>  um everyone has regrets i'm sure yeah i regret stuff  to just  relax and be yourself and just go ahead and it sounds cliche and i don't mean to sound that way but it's true it's just um you have to learn how to be comfortable with you and relax and just know you um to not compare yourself to other people because what someone else is doing or where they may be in their life at a certain time is not necessarily where you are supposed to be or what you're supposed to be doing at that time it doesn't mean that you're less competent or less able to do it it just means that everyone has their path and everyone has their  their time and their progression to how they get to things so i would tell me ten years ago to just believe in me and stay on my own path for what it is that i want for my life and don't be  yeah  um really enjoyed working with um well  okay a science project <laughter> with um my younger uh relatives my cousins we did a science project together and it was fun despite the mess we made it was a ball um being the first to attend college in my family and then um going to college and coming back to the community where i uh went to school and then teaching in that community and volunteering in that community and helping um youth or children that come from the same background that i came from so  uh i'm most proud of being able to  have the opportunity to improve and better myself and then to come back and help someone else improve and better themself as well   goodbye ,1
351,yes <clears throat> okay um new york um to pursue um music industry a job in the music industry  uh yes i'm self-employed um to become a music producer um it's pretty hard there's a lot of competition <laughter> um to pursue a job uh when um about a year ago last february it was pretty difficult east coast is a lot different than the west coast um i think i've been there twice in the past year no i'm more of a creature of habit um yes uh sometimes i feel like i don't fit into the crowd so um it's better just sometimes to be more quiet and view everything instead of uh you know going in and actively pursue things um <laughter> probably uh listen to music um and spend time with my dogs um <clears throat> probably um people being insensitive <insen> um not very um very nice to me or um seeing injustices or um i think that's about it <laughter> um pretty good you know sometimes <so> um probably couple of days ago um one of my friends was saying that um mm uh they were making a comment about how i am and i got kind of upset about that yeah it does <laughter> pretty close um my best friend so i um oh just one of my friends um i kind of am quiet about it and when a person pushes me to a certain point that's when i overreact usually um it's pretty hard um i rather the person notice that i'm kinda getting withdrawn and actively engage in me instead of getting it to the point where it's like um it it comes to a point where it blows out of proportion  um um probably spending time with my family in new york very close um my sister and my brother um i don't know they're just great people and i love them a lot and they're a lot like me so i feel like i have people that understand me um probably um i guess loyal um sensitive um <laughter>  i don't know it's kind of hard <laughter> it's a hard question <laughter> no no <clears throat>  yes gosh um i think probably nineteen ninety seven so a long time ago um i'm just uh during that time i was just going through a lot of issues and i was feeling unsafe to myself so i ended up going um to the doctor to kinda get meds and have therapy and stuff um not currently i i did about like six months ago um i just felt the therapist wasn't really helping me um i felt we kept on talking about the same things over and over and xxx she wasn't really challenging me and i've been in therapy for a really long time so i just knew it was a change it's okay <laughter> um yes i do actually um  when i feel connected to a therapist um and when i feel like it's a really great way for me to talk about what i'm going through um so yes i do um i'm better at describing my emotions and feelings i think the biggest thing is um when i'm in situations eh i can see myself reacting one way and i take a step back and see how i can react normally almost in a way um    also i tend to take a lot of my emotions and feelings and kind of bury them and make them feel like really bad about myself so it's nice to talk to someone that's not judging that doesn't really tell me like you know um they tell me it's o okay basically <clears throat> um feeling hopeless all the time not having you know enough energy to do things i used to like i had a little bit of concentration issues  um having weird disturbing thoughts sometimes just pop into my mind and just overall just feeling kinda crummy about life  um sometimes they are at  like random moments that if there's like a problem with like my interpersonal life or something like that or if i sometimes even seeing something on television um like sometimes that affects me  um listening to music or trying to distract myself um trying like my therapist told me for the longest time to journal to record things <clears throat>  um it's been a tough transition to come here so uh well being <be> being here um so um kinda half and half okay and not okay <laguhter>  um i feel like i've been a little bit with more withdrawn lately um but that's about it um <clears throat> some days it's great some days it's not um more recently it's been a little bit more difficult um i don't know why i have like a lot of thoughts on my mind at night <clears throat> so i tend not to sleep very well and i wake up quite frequently during the night <clears throat> um <clears throat> very groggy in the morning and um that's about it like during the day i tend to yawn a lot and my friends always are like oh why are you yawning so much are you disinterested <disisinterested> in what we're doing and then trying to tell them it's not that at all <laughter> um probably christmas time when i was with my family  um just really happy and um feeling like everything was alright in my life  having a good sense of like where i was at that moment being present with myself um probably you know um let's see that's a hard question i think probably i can tend to read people kinda well sometimes and um  uh i like to say uh i'm good at like being a good friend to people being a good family member um i'm a hard worker when i do have a job so <laughter>  um um sure i mean it's life so of course there's regrets um one that comes to mind is um the wish that i don't eat as much so i can be a lot more healthy <laughter>  um don't take things so seriously <laughter> um enjoy being youthful and um i think that's it <laughter> um i don't know that's a good question probably um my previous job and my employment i worked really well with kids um  so i did a great job at that i was um a researcher um at a hospital and i helped a lot of kids out for about six years so seven years  yeah it was awesome um i was really kind of like um  reading people and so i decided to major in psychology <clears throat> so uh and then i went a worked in a um mental health facility and did research um with them with um with drugs and depression and things like that so it found like a good niche for me <laughter> okay no problem <laughter> goodbye <laughter>,1
352,yes  i'm doing pretty good <laughter>  i'm from oklahoma  mhm yup oklahoma city  uh the weather is great i love being near the ocean and the palm trees and uh mountains i just love it here <laughter> um it was pretty easy there's a few differences it's a huge city compared to where i'm from so traffic has definitely been an adjustment for me <laughter>  um i just always wanted to live in california uh hated being landlocked in oklahoma just wanted to get out to the west coast be near the ocean   i studied psychology and minored in art  um no not at the moment  um well actually i think i misunderstood your question i'm not still working on my degree but i am working in the field of psychology i well i just got hired working at a group home for teenage boys who have been in trouble with the law  my dream job oh  i don't really know i think i just wanna help people however i can and um i just like working with people in the realm of psychology so i think i may already have my dream job <laughter> to relax i like to read or watch movies um i like to go to the beach and just watch the sunset or um hang out with friends  things that make me really mad um probably injustice towards other people um people being mistreated or abused um and people being lied to and deceived including myself i hate being lied to <laughter>  when i'm annoyed uh depends on the situation but i try to just like count to ten and take a deep breath and and not let my emotions cause me to react in a negative way so i just try and like calm down before i say anything  um it depends again on the situation and like who i'm angry with um most of the time i'm pretty good at controlling it but sometimes i think like like most people i'll lash out at the people that i'm closest to at times and and those moments i'm not that good at controlling it  <sigh> when was the last time i argued with someone it was probably with my parents um i've been having some some car trouble lately and i'm also running low on money so i'm sure i don't even remember exactly but i'm sure we kind of probably fought about the fact that i you know need to be more self-sufficient and independent take care of my own <laughter> things like car issues  i am very close with my family they're still in oklahoma but i talk to them on the phone all the time  oh definitely i mean my mom i think um she's probably the person that i'm closest to and she just  she's a great role model she's a wonderful person and she's very hardworking and very unselfish and i just wanna be like her in those ways  oh probably the time i went bungee jumping over the nile river in uganda um i still kinda have flashbacks of that moment just freefalling it was like the coolest experience ever and i love doing things that are crazy like that so it was a fun time <laughter> yeah well i have <ha> i have traveled a lot nowadays i don't travel so much anymore but i used to work for a cruise line um norwegian cruise line and so i would go travel all the time with them and then i also did an eleven month long trip around the world uh it was a mission trip so i just went and helped out in different third world countries it was really cool  uh i just love going to different places seeing new places and meeting all different types of people um because it's easy to just like get so absorbed in your own small bubble that you forget that there's a huge world out there and there's all different types of people with all different types of beliefs and it's just really cool to be able to branch out and see and meet those types of people and see just the diversity and the terrain of the earth even and the way that the earth looks in different places is cool  no i have not served in the military <laughter>  nope no i've never been formally diagnosed although i would say i've probably diagnosed myself with depression um just after having studied it a lot in psychology throughout the years i've i'm probably ninety nine percent sure that i've struggled with depression off and on so yeah   lately it's been pretty easy but throughout the years i've definitely had a lot of issues with insomnia um just like either not being able to fall asleep or just like waking up constantly throughout the night and so right now i'm not really experiencing too much of that but in the past it's definitely been an ongoing issue for me   i'm not a pleasant person when i don't sleep well sleep is extremely like important for me i think maybe more so than a lot of people i i like need good sleep to function  i've been feeling really good um  over the past several months i was unemployed um after coming out here and that was really really tough um and i just recently got offered my job um just like last week so i definitely think i've been going through a lot of crap and just a lot of depression but it's like lifted a lot of it has been lifted off me because i don't have that pressure any longer of like how am i gonna make ends meet this city's really expensive and i don't have a job and so i feel i feel much more relieved than i have been feeling which is good <laughter> um yeah well i mean just like i said over the past week or so i've become a lot more  positive i was kind of like feeling a bit like a hermit in a way it's just hard like being in a new city and not really knowing too many people and of course like i said not having a job kind of causes you to kind of just like be in your own shell i guess and that was kinda how it was how it's been for me and um just since i got offered the job i just have so much more confidence and like positivity that um things are are starting to work out for me which is good <laughter>    oh it was probably a couple of days ago actually i went um  i went to explore a part of the south bay area that i hadn't really been to before and it was i was just gonna go for a jog along the beach and it was really foggy outside and then the fog started to lift and um it was just beautiful and then i i went for a drive up off kind of off this like cliff where there's beautiful scenery that i'd never seen before and i just like was overwhelmed with how pretty it was and i was just like oh i can't believe that i get to live here so that was definitely a happy moment for me <laughter>  my best friend would probably say that i'm very daring and bold and fearless um that i'm unique and artistic and i don't i would guess that she'd probably say that i'm a non-conformist i don't really think the way that a lot of people do and i question everything so which can be a good or bad thing but yeah <laughter>  um  probably just like the fact that i i really try to live my life with like no regrets and just i try to live a very exciting life in a way and i think that especially ever since i finished college and have been traveling like i have and i've tried moving all different places by myself so i think just the fact that i i'm not really afraid i don't let things hold me back i just if i want something or if i wanna do something i can just do it and i guess in a way like i like that about myself and the fact that i'm really independent and can just go and do whatever i feel like doing even if it's hard i still i'm proud that i've overcome a lot of those struggles  oh there's like minor things that i regret throughout my life but there's not anything really major 'cause i think pretty much everything that i've done i've learned from whether it's good or bad so i wouldn't really change anything  oh <sigh> i would say i would tell myself when i was a kid that i  should just keep dreaming big and don't let anything that anyone says like stop me from believing that anything's possible because um i guess as i've grown into an adult i've really seen and started to really believe that truly anything is possible and if you really want something you can go after it and you can get it so i would just tell myself to never give up and just always believe that you can do what you wanna do  oh  let's see that's kind of hard <laughter>  um oh i guess i went home recently for christmas back to oklahoma and um i got to see some of my friends from college that i hadn't seen in some of 'em i hadn't seen in like since i graduated so um which has been like four years ago so um it was really awesome just to go out with them and we went to dinner and we went out afterwards and just had a good night and it was really really fun  cool you're welcome  bye ,1
353,yes  i'm okay  um pennsylvania  mhm um well i was in boston for a couple years and then i moved here about three and a half years ago but um i just wasn't satisfied with the quality of my life um maybe once or twice last year i only got to back once a year um definitely safer and um definitely a more um well i just miss it 'cause i have a lot of family back there but l_a is okay i i mean everyone loves the climate here um  not too easy i have two really good friends here and i have a boyfriend i've been with for three years so that helps he's from here but um it definitely took a a bit of adjustment  no um advertising communications  um no i'm currently working in actually i'm not working right now at the moment um i wanna be an osteopathic physician  um so basically versus western medicine an osteopathic physician is someone who helps someone with the symptoms and doesn't just treat the symptoms but treats them as a whole person so they look at nutrition they look at diet exercise um just a variety of things to <t> to actually get someone to live  a healthier life versus medications or things that are commonly prescribed now in the western medicine  um well one of the great things was when i came out here to l_a i was um exposed to the degree which i had never heard of living on the east coast   um sometimes  um well i'm very particular about the people i like to surround myself with um and eh i don't like to socialize with a lot of people i mean i tend to um like small intimate groups and i don't tend to like to be in larger or bigger groups um eh when people don't take into account other people's feelings  um i usually  try to go for a walk if i get <laughter> very irritated  um i'm usually really good it really takes a lot for me to spill over and to yell or become upset   um <sigh> let's see uh mm i was at with my lawyer and it was about his handling of my case  yeah it was he's uh they're i don't know i think they're just a little bit mediocre they're not the best lawyers   i have no idea <laughter>  um i'm very trustworthy i'm loyal um i care very deeply so i i like to try to help other people um and i always like to try to cheer people up so <laughter> i think that's that would be some of 'em  no yes  um just a few months ago about in the last six months  um i was experiencing  mental issues that i'd never really came across before paranoia and anxiety and i knew that it wasn't  um i knew that i it wasn't that i couldn't overcome it by myself  um a lot better i've been doing a lot of yoga and meditation um kinda seeing things from a different per view or another <ano> not per <pe> per view but a different view and um  that's helped but there's definitely times where i kind of sink back into thinking about the event especially because the event caused me to stop working   um  i think i you know i have a difficulty being in public um i'm still dealing with anxiety and paranoia about that and that something may happen so um so a lot of times during the day is when it happened so i'm not that comfortable going out during the day i tend to go out in the mornings and evenings and um i don't like to go into places where there's only one way in and one way out um well i've been gradually trying to increase how much i'm outside um  and i usually just deep breathing um i do a lot of breathing exercises and i just try to say that basically what i'm thinking or what's going on with me is not real um and that   i just i try <laughter> i just try to get myself to go into these places more gradually a lot better since uh the last couple months but before i very much pretty much stayed home    um  it's been good um it's been good to hear someone's feedback but um i feel like i've gotten more help with just my inner talk with just kind of sitting with myself and journaling  i do  um <sigh> well i feel like more like myself which is a huge improvement um and i am more cautious and er guarded in some ways about my thoughts um and about my decisions as well i'm not so i'm not so oh you know i'll just do this and not really think of the consequences of other things that i want in my life   um it's gotten better i'm okay <ok> i'm better now um the first three months it was very difficult i couldn't sleep through the night and i woke maybe two or three times and would be awake for a couple hours but now i am um sleeping through the night again  um i feel <f> groggy <sigh> k i feel foggy and out of it um  and just low kind of depressed  mm <sigh> it's um i think it's been awhile  um working <laughter> i'm a bit of a workaholic um spending time with my family um yeah just being outside enjoying nature reading um very close  what is that  um scrubbed_entry um well my parents 'cause they've always been very supporting and loving um giving me feedback about my decisions or what i'm choosing to do but allowing me to make my own um decisions my own choices in life and then  my sisters have just always been very um you know just always checking with me i'm the baby i'm the youngest in the family so they always um  looking out for me and just checking in with me and then my boyfriend xxx with this um incident that happened um he's been very uh usually supportive with just letting me kind of have my talk and work things out and understanding when i'm feeling and not wanting to go out in public and and being aware of that that it's not so easy for me just to do something like grocery shop or um running errands without having a lot of anxiety  um i'm most proud of  the jobs the work that i've done the people i've helped um  maybe that i took this job where i was assaulted at <laughter> that would be it going into retail into unsafe environment not listening to my gut  um  what advice would i what uh to recklessly pursue your dreams um that there is no such thing as too late or running out of time and and to enjoy every moment of your life not take anything for granted  um  let's see uh <sigh> well cooking i really enjoy <enj> i really enjoy cooking um  so i made some roasted vegetables just any time i'm cooking i just really enjoy it um we have a garden so we had collard greens that came up and um some chilis and cauliflower so just using preparing that for <f> um for my um boyfriend and i  mhm bye thanks ,1
354,yes i'm alright with this doing pretty good little bit tired i'm from los angeles the weather and the sports can't find any jobs right now i know um not really i studied um architecture and chicano studies and a little bit of history  uh since <si> i was <wa> little <li> since i was little i liked to draw and then i like to learn about history i'm trying to i'm going i'm working and going to school i'm trying to get my finish gettin' my degree playing in the n_f_l what was that um i don't know what that is eat or sleep people not doing they jobs walk away um pretty good like three days ago a couple days ago over some family issues um sure well um like to workout play football and ride my bike um walking on that u_c_l_a i felt big like i actually was doing something with myself my parents like they struggle <strug> they whenever they struggle they still manage to put through whatever they want and i'm pretty close real close uh quiet um my height and strength  mm no no no it's pretty hard uh i i get home late and i'm usually up for like fifteen to like eighteen hours during the day so by the time i get home i'm really not even that tired to go to sleep yeah uh if i don't sleep well i get i wake up grumpy or like not in the mood to do things  mm just like under pressure a little bit not that hard i just stress pretty much sometimes just working i really don't like working but i have to so  um a little bit like it's not i'm not like a little bit more violent but just a side <s> just a side effect from not playing football for a while music eating or and working out um i don't know raising my son and while i was still in school in high school no patience watching your son grow uh i have a five and a half year old boy i don't only see him on the weekend pretty close spoiled they're they're so advanced with everything that it makes the like their grandparents feel like dinosaurs while they already they just born and they already know how to use everything around their house can't treat 'em like kids anymore mm so you pretty much treat 'em like adults sometimes it works some it doesn't do it doesn't really work no should have just stayed on one path follow my dreams probably like or just follow what i wanted to do and that's about it a couple months ago um i was i was playing football i was playing for a junior college and we made it to the championship bowl that was probably the happiest i've been in awhile  good thank you bye,1
355,yes alright  i was born in uh los angeles california  uh well the weather and uh  the fact that uh people aren't so obtrusive like on the east coast  uh just the uh the traffic and the the smoggy weather  i used to i'm unemployed now so i rarely go anywhere  i have a b_s in uh business with a uh computer uh option i thought that the only place i could get a job with a business <bu> business degree was in accounting or in business computer methods so i took that i took business computer methods option  oh i'd probably be like uh a professional sports player or an actor something something that you enjoy doing  i like to uh ride my bike i like to watch sporting events now i can't afford to go to them so i pretty much watch on t_v  i like to travel but like i say that i don't have money for that anymore  that's alright  uh <sigh> people who are chicken heads they get their nose in other people's business even if they're just strangers you expect that from a family member or or a friend but you know especially with the internet that feeds a lot of that now we know what orwell was referring to when he spoke of big brother in nineteen eighty four  uh i don't do much much different than i would otherwise  uh and i've had many temper outbursts uh  i kinda argue with my aunt  and it was because she was basically  making leading statements trying to trap me into saying something about a relative and uh it annoyed me greatly   uh i'm kind of on the outs with my parents  i'm kind of the black sheep  oh uh i mean my mom's done the most to help me she's done a lot you know more than uh anybody by far well i mean she's just  i remember one time when i was in like thirteen i went with a friend of mine to see the crosby stills nash and young concert at the forum  and she has seven kids and she picked me up at the sizzlers right across the street from the forum at uh eleven o'clock at night and i couldn't imagine with all she had to do that day that she agreed to do that but she did  oh probably uh  going down to the cape at the end of uh baja peninsula there's cabo san lucas or taking <ta> photographing the bridalveil falls in yosemite  uh it was probably the two most majestic seen <see> sights i've ever seen  it was when i could afford to travel  no no i was diagnosed with depression after a hospital visit in april of two thousand eleven    and uh i took some lexapro but i stopped after one day i didn't wanna do it anymore  no because i didn't feel it was helpful i feel i was becoming a zombie  yeah  depressed about not having a job for over two years i lost my job in october two thousand and ten and except for day you know jobs like this which i'm fortunate to get just you know daily things focus groups like that i haven't worked  thank you  especially when you're fifty six years old  well mm eh just uh it just the i guess the general feeling of hopelessness   i get out on my bicycle a lot and walk or bike just four hours a day split about two hours each  yeah good to get some very easy  'cause now i'm old when i was young i couldn't sleep more than six <s> four six hours a night  because i'm restless  no but now that i'm old i i i sleep much more easily  i pray before i go to sleep and that's that's that's when i can't have any trouble sleeping i just pray recite different prayers like the lord's prayer hail mary stuff like that and i'm able to fall off to sleep  i don't know probably uh  can't have any specific remembrances  of of that you know it was when i had money to spend i know that and when i had to have a job to have money to spend so it was probably fifteen years ago  well i haven't really enjoyed anything uh last week i did a uh made seventy five dollars on a job with the the county basically it was an emergency preparedness exercise they were running for their personnel and they enlisted people to play the basically the relatives of people who had been in a in a fall uh bombing at the staples center and we you know asked questions signed up you know told 'em gave 'em the information i'm missing  you know relatives and basically it was provided by the county and basically went through a routine in downtown l_a  not not hard it was just uh just a routine we had to follow we had to act like we were actually missing somebody and had to give the specifics of their characteristics height weight etcetera    i don't have a best friend  uh  i'm uh very bright i'm a perfectionist at my job  i'd say that's about it  i got a business degree and i've never been a motivated person i went to school i went to two state colleges and two junior colleges to meet that end so i believe that was probably the most significant contribution <con> contribution that i i made to my  you know to my uh i guess self esteem you might say so i had something to hang on the wall  yeah i regret you know  alienating family members  i would've uh  basically not been so impetuous and left left jobs thinking <think> thinking that  you know i could always get another one and not you know basically blow off jobs i could probably work at one of the employers that i used to work for now  they've added locations but i burned bridges there so that's not possible  thank you  hasta luego ,1
356,yes  okay  from here from eh from alhambra  uh the weather's really nice and everything's very familiar  uh sometimes there's too much congestion on the roads too too much traffic  i i studied art and photography uh it it wasn't so much a decision i just kept noticing that i was very interested in it  yes  i'm a photographer  mhm oh i suppose uh  um running a family portrait studio or some other type of photography business  uh no not no i'm an also an apartment manager it keeps me tied down  um it's uh fair it's not the greatest because of being an apartment manager i've i do have free rent but i have to stay there a lot so  that part does the free rent part is very good  oh gosh my most memorable experience that's hard to say  um  well i mean there's good and bad memorable experiences  oh well i guess some s s s like sport success when i was in high school there was a few of the things that i was happy about and some art pieces i've made were memorable and  some bad things would be my father's death you know but those are very memorable not good though  uh  well my parents and my i i have a lot of brothers and sisters uh so <s> so the my family uh fairly close but they most of them live around l_a uh there's a few that are from far <f> distant <di> uh distant my brother lives in new york and   my other brother lives in maui <clears throat>  mhm oh mostly very talented <ss> um just um more involved in technology than maybe i was or am and they're um i think they're more of a hive mind than when i grew up just seems like they were all hooked into social media  uh go on a walk or watch television  or play with my computer  and uh um well  there's some <so> some uh  there's some kind of uh  injustices that happen in not not <n> not big deals but for example our parking situation got worse with some new district parking eh that's kind of upsetting and the city doesn't seem to wanna  uh make any exceptions or change some rules  and also uh some unfair things at work sometimes happen that are upsetting <ups> uh that are upsetting uh yeah i worked for <f> in school <sch> uh uh at a high school <sch> i worked at a high school dance uh this last weekend and when we arrived at the site   the people at the site said we couldn't set up all of our equipment and backdrops and things at the location where we were assigned to do it that we had to go outside  and then to get an okay to go inside because being outside we weren't prepared for nor <no> nor told in advance that we were to be outside um it delayed our setup time and that doesn't <does> wouldn't have bothered me except that on monday morning um the school called <call> called our boss and complained that we were late setting up when it when they told us to wait for them and we told them we would be delayed if we wait and did we still get a complaint so that that part is upsetting and  and our work doesn't back us up the at the office they just need to please the school to maintain the account so uh often when that something like that happens it means they will not send you out to work at that school again which to would translate into less payroll hours for the the photographers that were on that job  that's yeah that's how they do things so that that is upsetting  uh most of the time that will i i dust off my resume <laughter> and start looking for other situations that are that might be better um  yeah  uh pretty good <sigh> i i i usually xxx might uh i in the moment i don't really lose it but xxx later i might um vent or something like that but on the spot <sp> on the location i wouldn't do that  um well just today um we have a uh schedule <sc> tight schedule today and i have a friend that i'm car <c> sharing a car with today and uh we we were arguing where to go first  and um so we compromised and did most of her things and one of my things then after  this <th> this was one of the things is over then we're gonna do some more of her things so but it yeah  no post-traumatic stress syndrome is that what that is  uh no i have not yes  oh <sigh> i'd say nineteen eighty yeah i think believe it was nineteen eighty yeah  um well my father noticed some symptoms my father is just well he's passed away but he was a psychiatrist  um well i wasn't sleeping i was laying around the house  um i was waking up at noon <laughter> something like and i didn't have a um focus like for getting a job it wasn't clear enough uh i i remember some job interviews that i'd go to their front door and then i wouldn't go in <laughter> and i think that was all all part of depression  yeah i thought i had a problem but i didn't know what it was  no uh well eh i went for three years and then the psychiatrist said that  he thought that i was done <laughter> but uh and i and i i did get to a much better place i have to watch all the time to see what's going on with depression so i think i i'll have good days and bad days  um i think therapy makes you see what the um  like the i i thought of it as a filter or wearing a pair <pa> as if you were put on a depression pair of sunglasses you don't really you see everything through that so you have to kinda <k> i have to sort of try to take the those glasses off for a little bit and double check am i really perceiving these things accurately  or am i seeing it through a depressed viewpoint and i try to look for clues about that   i think i'm um slipping back a little bit uh uh i don't do well during unemployed periods i've noticed in my path in my past and um right now we have a work slow down so it's easy to slip back into sleeping too late or putting things off because the schedule's too wide open for for me for me personally as a depressed person i think that structure is really important it um it gets you out of bed and you have to get somewhere in time and deal interact with people is all those are all beneficial things for someone who's tends to be depressed   uh  well i don't know if it's changes as i a little bit i just tend to be focused on some things that are probably not that um uplifting let's say uh but it's more negative like i have <ha> have been sort of thinking about how um um soldiers in the past uh i don't know why but like the in during the roman era <er> era or the greeks <gree> ancient greeks how it would've been like to be in a in a frontline battle with  mm you know just crude <cru> kind of crude <cru> in my opinion crude weapons and no medical help and  the i don't know i seem <se> my mind seems to go there a lot where i'm just thinking about that and i've been looking <look> looking at it and reading books about that or um video clips on youtube and eh things like that or um some other things <thi> other uh kinda like terrible doom type themes like i was watching on the animal show like crocodile attacks and things like that  where probably shouldn't dwell so much on that  oh you mean in life in general yeah well i think i regret not finishing college i think i had a i think i was <wa> uh was going into depression right then and wasn't coping in my senior year very well and um didn't really i didn't get out of college with a degree although i was there seven years but uh so that's very that's a big regret that i have um  i think it would've been to um  at certain points i probably should've sought <so> um sought therapy and also probably some uh outside help just with um getting through finals just the logistics i had i was an art major and i had no car so   a a lot of the art projects and things were difficult to move back and forth and and also to uh meet at away locations i think it probably would've been worth it to   do whatever it took to get a car <laughter> at that time so  um  well i'm i've been told i'm very patient  and also i have um some original original artistic ideas   so  um those are those are good qualities i'm very loyal and and also um  you know i support my friends i'm fairly generous with them  so yeah  um let's see  xxx really enjoyed was i had a  i had a nice experience uh just uh photographing um a soccer game recently   i really enjoyed that so  mhm okay  it was my pleasure  thank you goodbye ,1
362,yes  good  from california  i like the eh arts and entertainments i like the uh you have a lot of freedom to work in a lot of different fields um i like the fact that the weather is great um i like the fact that all my roots are here all my family is here   i don't like how hard it is to get places anymore it's very hard there's so much traffic it takes a long time to get where you're going um it's expensive it's a lot more expensive than it used to be   not anymore  i studied journalism english music and special effects makeup  i am  now i am managing a doggy day care facility  my dream job is to  own my own company again um probably working with animals  no i'm i'm an artist i draw i paint i do tattoos i work a lot with animals i like outdoor activities biking hiking   um people that aren't fair people that are   angry and um people that are dishonest  usually i will give myself like a ten second timeout and think about it before i speak or react  i'm very good at controlling my temper  probably my spouse um about something to do with our financial matters  i'm very close to my children and my father  scrubbed_entry no it's never easy it's the hardest job in the world but it's the best  just um wanting to prevent your children from making the mistakes you've had but you realize that they have to do that just to learn how to live life um that's one of the hardest things is letting them make their own mistakes  the uh unconditional love my boys have for me the  everything that being a parent has made me a better person it's made me a better everything a better employee um i've i think being having my children made me um much better person every day  probably i have a lot i've had a very full life i would be really hard to say to narrow that down i've had so many  i'm a good friend i'm a true friend i'm honest i'm real i'm dependable and i don't play games i'm very i'm no <n> i'm no drama    no yes i have in um  february of two thousand eleven  i was attacked by a stalker and almost killed in november of two thousand nine he broke into my apartment and laid in wait for me and attacked me when i came in the door and tried to kill me  i do  i think therapy has helped me tremendously i don't think i'd be able to hold a job and be responsible and be   a productive member of society <s> of society without therapy  i'm able to handle things better i don't get so um emotionally upset um a lot more rational i try to stay more rational than emotional more rational and logical  so-so i've been sick and i've been uh run down a little stressed out  i have yes i have i use the resources <res> draw on the resources that i've learned and i reach out to other people i try not to isolate i try to um use the tools that have been given to me in therapy um i don't use medication anymore so it's mainly just proactive treatment where i have to uh do something about it  it's not it's never easy it's always bad  tired lethargic um it's hard to keep my thoughts in order it's hard just to do the basics during the day   mm no i can't remember oh i went to the beach with my oldest son and his best friend and we rode three real three-wheel bikes and that was a lot of fun  it's hard to say right now i haven't decided i'm very proud of my children i would say that's probably it they're really good boys  i have too many regrets right now  to finish school to um  stay focused to not  let myself get distracted um to focus more on long-term goals than short-term goals my father  i'm very honest i'm very calm  i don't get angry easily it takes a lot to provoke me  i'm uh reliable if i say i'm gonna do something i do it  and i'm uh i'm not i'm basically what you see is what you get i don't i don't pull any punches with people   um anything to do with animals i love animals i always smile around animals any kind big small  um i like older people elderly people i like to help them and be around them i like children um ,1
367,<sync> yes i'm okay um i'm a little pensive i guess a little uh down but more or less okay i was born in annapolis maryland on the east coast originally i moved because i went to film school um and but then i decided to come i moved to washington d_c to do some work and now i'm back here again it's very different um being from the east coast it just has a different feel to it um but living l_a is very has a very different kind of um attitude i guess and so it's a little difficult but i but i've gotten more used to it since i've been here uh not at all um when i left things got things were sort of i i lost my job out there and so i had to move out here kind of quick to um to be with uh some people who were gonna help me out and i'm just sort of i don't know if estranged is the right word but i'm just kind of not really speaking to my family or old friends that often it's not easy it's it's kind of um i miss i miss a lot of people i miss my old life before i lost my job um i miss um some friends um i miss a lot of the relationships that i had out there um so it's difficult i mean it weighs on my mind a lot um i feel like i failed and now i'm here and i can't seem to get back on my feet so it's it's it's hard depends on the situation i think i'm outgoing when i'm comfortable um and then i'm extremely outgoing but when i'm in a situation i'm not comfortable with i tend to be a lot more shy so that doesn't really answer your question but um [clears throat] i have certain i do i do a lot of writing um i have certain music that i listen to as i'm writing and when i can when i can get really into that and sort of shut out the rest of the world um the music and the the thoughts just kind of happening really um it can it soothes me it's like it's when i feel most relaxed i guess um a few weeks ago i guess i was i'd been working on a book on a on a on a novel and when i was really when i was really getting into writing it and um it was really working for me that was that was good that was really good i felt like i was accomplishing something and i felt really relaxed um it was about a guy who is searching for something it's it's uh it's his last day on earth and so he's going to find a person that he that he met and just was so struck by that he needs to he needs to find her and spend the last few minutes that he has on earth with her just because sort of uh it's sort of romantic adventure comedy kind of thing well i've always i've always been a writer part of the reason i came to l_a was because of screenwriting um so i wrote some screenplays and uh you know had a little success with that out here and but since since then i've kind of gotten tired of the limitations of the screenwriting and i've started to write more short stories and and longer just creative writing so i i've been meaning to write a novel but i was just waiting for the idea to to really hit me it's not easy the [exhale] the parts the parts when it's good it's really good but getting there is sometimes a real struggle um i find it difficult i have a real love hate relationship with writing when i when i love it i just absolutely love it but sometimes i hate it because it's so difficult um but it's worth it for the times when it's when it's good good i don't i don't really have a temper i it's not i mean most of my anger that i have is directed inward as opposed to outward to other people um if something is really really stressful or if i'm in a situation like a very intense confrontation i can lose it but i probably <prob> that's probably only happened to me three four times in my whole life i mean generally i pretty much try to it when i'm upset i i get upset with myself not with other people um last night i guess well <weh> um i got in an argument about whether or not cleaning vegetables was necessary because of i forget it but it well no it was about whether you can clean vegetables after you cut them because i'd already started cutting the vegetables and i thought that would be okay so it turned into this big argument and we did google searches to figure out who was right and who was wrong and i i ended up being wrong on that one but it is yeah that was it wasn't a blow up argument but it was a definite argument um uh a lot so much um uh i i i was in uh a relationship that i really really um that i really wanted to work and uh i ended up and it was partly due to i hadn't i was on i wasn't on the right medication and so i was going at like everything sort of spiraled out of control and i feel really guilty about the way that that ended and i mean i wasn't i wasn't mean but i was but i was getting more and more messed up and i couldn't stop it and it ended and so i feel really guilty about not doing enough and and not and and you know making her have to tell me that she never wanted to see me again so that was pretty that was pretty tough well some of it was was that i wasn't medicated properly i mean now i've been to a doctor and i'm on medication that's completely kind of i mean i still get i still get upset and i still get depressed but it's not like it was it's not i don't completely lose it for days at a time um so i mean i know there's a part of me that knows logically that it wasn't all my fault and that if i had if i had been able to deal with the chemicals in my brain then i would've then it would've probably be different if i was who i am now then i would've i would i would be i would be it probably would have gone very differently or maybe it wouldn't have but i mean i could have i don't know i don't know if i could've done anything different things being how they were i mean it's it's possible uh i mean obviously yeah because i mean that's what i do i i take little things <thin> i mean i take little things and i just think about them all the time in my head until until it drives me crazy i dwell on stuff um and it's like any little detail that comes up i suddenly remember and it can just throw me off for a whole day i mean i still i still get i still get really uncomfortable and embarassed and then feel ashamed about stuff that i did in high school which was years and years ago which i shouldn't even be thinking about anymore 'cause it's so in the past but i still get that feeling like i'm right back there well it's it's not easy i've been trying to figure out ways to deal with it i i mean i dealt with it for a long time by by by drinking and and you know just trying to like slow my mind down that way um but you know since the medication it's been better it hasn't been impossible to deal with it hasn't been easy but it's but it's been better um well like i said i do a lot of you know if i'm if i'm writing or if i'm doing anything like i kind of have to almost be doing two things at once to occupy my brain completely um if i'm watching t_v i have to be playing a game on my phone if i'm using i'm the computer i have to be you know watching a t_v show or a movie on you know on in another window so that i can just keep my mind occupied during all of that um i just need i mean i i wish that i could just sort of let the thoughts come and deal with them but i just i can't yet they're triggered by everything pretty much anything that i that i see if i if i if i hear somebody with a dutch last name if i if i hear somebody talk about wisconsin if i hear you know people talk about just anything you know i can reach back and connect to to this it's really it's really i don't know that's the thing i mean i don't ever get a break from it yeah um i don't know i'm a very light sleeper so i awake and asleep and awake and asleep <asl> i have no problem going back to sleep but i generally you know don't i don't know i never really needed much sleep so it's just only recently that i've really started to to like feel the effects of not getting enough sleep like i would i would usually stay up until two or three in the morning so that i could just be so exhausted that i could just conk out and wake up the next day and feel fine go to work um but now it's it's it's like if i do that i can't i still don't get enough sleep i don't conk out i still just sleep very lightly you know i get up i toss and turn all night you know and now it's just it's yeah i don't sleep too great right now um pretty i mean i don't know it's hard to it's hard to know i i usually just kind of power through it and just i'm uh i'm like how i am now just i just feel bad um i think about three three four years ago um it was when i i had been given taking stuff for anxiety for for years before that but then i finally got a psychiatrist who actually sat down and talked to me and said you've actually got this situation and we need to get you on the medication that you're on is not working you need to get on this new medication that will actually start to like even you out and heal you a little bit from all this so so yeah that was that was kind of a a turning point but unfortunately it happened after everything uh went bad so i don't know in the moment i don't know i don't really think i thought about it too much then but looking back on it i feel it really makes me angry it really makes me you know given where i am right now it makes me really angry that i'm that i had to that i i lost everything because because of chemicals in my brain because of things that i couldn't control and that you know the people that were supposed to help me weren't helping me i mean i was paying i was paying a lot of money to to go see doctors and they were doing and they you know it wasn't it was it didn't help it didn't work until until you know i managed to find somebody who did work and i just yeah so i'm i'm like thanks guys for helping but it was a little it's a little late now um there really wasn't any choice i had to i was i was a mess i was it was either i was i was self medicating it was affecting my work i mean it was everything was just at there was a point where i really realized that i mean i just had to like make this different but again it was too late because you know then my review came up a few months later and you know after after everything after being institutionalized once or twice and all this stuff you know they just decided that i was just not worth keeping around so they laid me off but it was at least that and not firing me but but but yeah but so i got help but it was but it wasn't soon enough uh not not as much as i should um i go to a couple of meetings i go to i go to a_a so that i can um you know keep control of that aspect too <t> too and there's a there's a therapy aspect to that um unfortunately you know being unemployed my unemployment ran out you know i'm i'm you know i'm getting my medication from the city of l_a so you know i'm not really in a position to put money into seeing somebody so i have a psychiatrist that i go see but it's really very i've i've only seen her three times in the past year so it's basically to keep my medication coming and then there's you <laughter> right well like i said i mean just the talk <tah> i mean the the let's just take the a_a for example because that's probably the closest <cloth> closest for that i'm seeing with therapy for now um just saying stuff outloud is just like getting getting this stuff out trying to figure out how to take that mess that's in your stomach and in your brain and make it into words and sentences that make sense that you can actually deal with is a big step like regardless of who you're saying it to whether it's a therapist or just a room full of of drunks you know i mean you're you're taking all that stuff that's that's really been killing you and you're making it into something you can deal with something that you can write down something that you can talk about as opposed to just letting it just sit there as this formless thing yeah um you know better than i than i have been um i mean it it sort of it goes <g> it has its ups and downs um you know i'm applying for jobs five six jobs or more a a day you know and never getting a response never getting an interview never even getting close to to to being self sufficient again um it's hard but that's like real world problems i feel like the chemical parts are getting under control like the the depression is getting under control so now it's just i have to deal with real life which is it just has its it's just its own own challenge yeah um it was probably you know a couple years ago um i i was i mean the thing that immediately comes to mind uh is everything was going well at my job i was making these great videos with with this person that i that iwas having a relationship with and we were really close we were having fun together and we went out and got a christmas tree and we spent the all this time picking out the perfect christmas tree and it was just feeling like a part of somebody's life and feeling like a part of the bigger the bigger life that's that's out there you know like what normal people feel you know for that instant i felt like a normal person doing a normal thing with a pretty girl who he really really liked a lot and you know everything was going really well and i mean it wasn't going really well because it was all messed up but for that instant i felt like a normal person a normal happy person and part of what makes it so hard now is knowing that i don't know if i'll ever feel that again so um probably the probably this educational <educary> educational series i did uh an educational uh video series i did for the national science foundation um it was it it was really hard and it but in the end it turned out really good and you know i'm hoping that it helps a lot of kids and it helps the world with getting kids excited about science and about um and about the world around them so that i feel like that was a real contribution that i made to the world oh it was part of you know it was part of my my job um it was it was a we were trying to come up with with new ideas uh for because we would put together videos and stuff to give you know to to schools and everything and they had done those before but we decided to do something really big you know and there was a lot of traveling and there was a lot of um and there was a lot to it and so it was probably the biggest project that the n_s_f had decided to do and so we just kind of produced it right that doesn't yeah um i guess <grunt> i don't know <laughter> uh i don't know it's been a it's been a while since i've really thought about that i don't know would i go somewhere would i i i i don't know thank you,1
372,<synch> yes um pretty good kind of <laughter> yeah <laughter> about los angeles yes the thing i like about l_a the weather it's not easy to meet people well it just feels like people aren't out very much they're like that movie in crash where people are just sit in their cars all the time um it feels like that no not too much child development well i have a son and i wanted to know how to be a a good mom and so i wanted to know about the stages uh that he would be going through eh and be able to relate better to him mhm i am kind of i'm trying to get it started again in the fall i'd like to write well um i've written some children's books and i've just been doing research looking into getting my books published it's only like two that i've written so far but they're pretty good i've gotten some good feedback on them from my critique groups <laughter> it's about a little boy that's surrounded by people that are jerks and he tries to not become a jerk with them and <laughter> it puts him in like a really scrubbed_entry he goes through a lot of moods dealing with the people in his life mhm um no i've had some issues some nervous breakdowns actually and right now my son is staying with his dad so <laughter> um no i'm a single mom it was the hardest thing i think in the world <laughter> is being a single mom <laughter> so how do i cope <deep breath> um <sigh> well right now um i didn't have very many good <goo> coping skills or mechanisms so that was the problem it's so spontaneous like the stuff that comes outta kids' mouths sometimes and the stuff that they do and just brings a smile to your face um well when my son was younger once we were just sitting around the house and he comes and he starts doing my hair and he says to me mom i want you to put on some lipstick and high heels and ponytails so you can go out and get married and find a boyfriend <laughter> so yeah it's pretty spontaneous things like that happen that my kid's telling me i need to not be single anymore <laughter> the hardest thing <sigh> not wanting to screw it up i feel a lot of stress and pressure that every little thing is gonna make <ma> make a difference and matter in what kind of person my kid turns out to be and so it's a lot of stress on yourself <laughter> yeah yeah <laughter> definitely um hmm i think i'm different from my mom because i'm a little bit more tolerant of that spontaneous interaction i welcome it you know i welcome getting to know who my child is right now and not try to mold them into somebody that i want them to be but just see them become the best child that they can be the best adult that they can be without molding them in that direction necessarily into a different person <laughter> so say it again who's someone that's a positive influence um <sigh> mm i don't really have anybody like that okay well i've tried to meditate sometimes but i don't really stick with it often enough um i've tried to like go for walks but i don't always do that and i don't always stick with it <laughter> so yeah that's about it <sigh> i'd say i'm a little below average meaning that i get angry more than most people do i think hmm last night <laughter> but it was on the telephone i was arguing with my husband um we have my sister lives with us and she lives with us in a very small room with a small apartment i should say and she's got four people living in in one room so um it's kind of stressful it's really crowded and my husband is stressed out about it and you know i'm just saying to him that i told you so i told you if my sister moved in here then there was gonna be a mess in the house and she's gonna be asking for things you don't really wanna do that's just how my sister is <laughter> so the house is messy and it's crowded and every day they're asking for rides and my husband he's avoiding coming home because all these people are home and he doesn't wanna be there anymore and i'm just saying that he's gonna have to find a way to deal with it because he asked for it in my opinion <laughter> so <laughter> hmm it does <laughter> oh i've got tons of 'em but right now what's on my mind is um losing custody of my son um right now like i've been arguing with my stepmom and my stepsister for a long time about my son and how they treat him and how i want him to be treated like they don't have any boundaries and i believe that boundaries are important establishing who's the adult who's the child they let my child boss 'em around and stuff anyways because of this they're gonna be testifying against me in the custody trial saying that yeah they're gonna be saying that i'm not a good mom because i believe in having boundaries and we have very different ideas about child raising she's my stepmom she's my dad's fifth wife and she's she really doesn't she's really far removed from how i was raised and i wanna raise my child more similar to how i was raised where you're we had some independence and we had some boundaries and we knew what the rules were and what was expected of us and with my stepmom she xxx no rules she has no expectation she just wants him to run wild and have everything that he wants and that's fine when you're a grandparent but the problem is that i live with them sometimes and when i'm in the same house with them they should be following my rules and not trying to go and break all of my rules <sigh> anyway <laughter> yeah um in that moment <sigh> just really frustrated because they don't listen to me i feel disrespected i feel like invisible i feel just angry that they're taking away my right to parent and it's something that i worked really hard to do i went to school and i studied child development i've read all the magazines and i've read the books and i'm really <laughter> i know what i'm talking about i feel confident in my parenting skills and my parenting abilities and to have these people that haven't done the same thing and worked as hard as i have to be a good parent try and tell me that i'm a bad parent it's really uh hard to believe so i feel very disrespected um unacknowledged angry frustrated all those things <laughter> um i take i take benadryl to help me sleep and i'm so <laughter> my doctor gave me that <laughter> uh she gave me benadryl told me that i could take it to help me sleep and last night i was crying before i went to sleep so sometimes these thoughts start running through your head at night when you're in bed but i tried to push them out and then i got up and i took my benadryl so i could go to sleep more easily <laughter> yeah i'm always thinking about my son how i wish he was with me and how unfair everything is that's happening <sniffle> and like i don't deserve to have my son taken from me because i'm a really good mom you know <sobbing> and i'm too hard on myself so but i am a good mom and i feel confident that i'm a good mom i just i don't really have the money to take care of my son like my dad the son's dad does he has more money than me and right now i'm trying to be okay with it because i know he can do more for him financially than i could but that doesn't mean i'm not a good mom <laughter> hmm i'm pretty depressed i'm on anti-depressants um i take wellbutrin i been on them for a couple weeks now i think they're working i don't know i'm not as down as i was i mean i got here today i got dressed <laughter> i made it out and i'm here today so not that bad um <sigh> hmm my husband complains a lot he says i'm not the same person that i was when he married me he said i was fun and i was positive and i was all these other optimistic things that's another thing he was on the phone telling me last night and <sniffle> and i'm not those things anymore <laughter> which is true i mean we got married a year ago and then my son was taken shortly after and it was just such a shock and um i've just been trying to get back from it but it's been hard did i think i had a problem before i found out found out what oh um yeah like crying a lot something like i cry all the time <sobbing and laughing> it doesn't take much for me to cry i'm just crying thinking about crying but like um my family would invite me to family events and i would go and just just cry because my son wasn't there <sniffle> or um i don't know it's just all the crying i think and like i said my husband letting me know that i'm not the same person so he's disappointed and i feel bad even that <crying and laughing> i'm not the same person that he he knew <crying and laughing> i feel bad about that too another thing i'm feeling bad about you know <crying> yes i do i try do i feel like the therapy's useful um yeah it's nice to talk about your problems i go in there and i cry every week so at least i have a set time every week where i can go in and cry <laughter> um that's i mean it's a release to be able to cry sometimes i feel better afterwards um yeah and she helps me make decisions you know help me to be more proactive in my life um well i'm looking for jobs and things like that and she gives me ideas of why don't you work here or why don't you work there or have you thought about this or that you know and then she said something about why don't you go back to school and so i went and applied to go back to school you know i'm not doing much with my life and sitting around all day isn't helping my depression any either so i'm trying to find a work and i applied for college in the fall i got accepted to dominguez hills so i may be going back to school in the fall right now i'm still looking for work but she helps me with that kinda stuff just giving me ideas that life isn't over <laughter> that there's still more you know i could be doing with life life yeah everything's always bittersweet um i don't know last time i was really happy i don't know <laughter> my ideal weekend oh i don't have a lot of money 'cause i'm not working right now so really my weekends are just spent reading maybe but i can't really i i can't pay much attention when i'm reading so <laughter> i have a short attention span i can only read a couple chapters <deep breath> um but lately i say that's what i've been doing is reading something i've read xxx okay i like to go to u_s_c they have these nights where they have things like book signings or poetry and art it's called visions and voices so i like to go out to <t> to their events and i usually enjoy those um about two weeks ago um deborah harkness was there doing a book signing for a discovery of witches and so like i said i'm trying to be a writer so i try to go especially to the book signings and see what it's like to be an author who's talking to a crowd and signing books <laughter> my son <laughter> i don't have any friends my best qualities um <sigh> i'm smart i'm good-looking um i'm really um and like a hard worker i i'm dedicated to like self-improvement um that's all i can think of right now <laughter> okay okay goodbye press the buzzer now,1
